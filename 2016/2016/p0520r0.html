Trivial copy/move constructor for class with volatile member
</H4><B>Section: </B>12.8&#160; [class.copy]
 &#160;&#160;&#160;

 <B>Status: </B>tentatively ready

<P>The resolution of issue 496
included the addition of 12.8 [class.copy]
paragraph 25.2, making a class's copy/move constructor
non-trivial if it has a non-static data member of
volatile-qualified type.  This change breaks the IA-64 ABI,
so it has been requested that CWG reconsider this aspect of the
resolution.</P>

<P>On a related note, the resolution of
issue 496 also changed
3.9 [basic.types] paragraph 9, which makes
volatile-qualified scalar types &#8220;trivial&#8221; but
not &#8220;trivially copyable.&#8221; It is not clear why
there is a distinction made here; the only actual use of
&#8220;trivial type&#8221; in the Standard appears to be in
the description of <TT>qsort</TT>, which should probably use
&#8220;trivially copyable.&#8221; (See also
issue 1746.)</P>

<P><B>Notes from the February, 2016 meeting:</B></P>

<P>CWG agreed with the suggested direction for the changes in
12.8 [class.copy]; the use of &#8220;trivial&#8221; will
be dealt with separately and not as part of the resolution of this
issue.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2016):</B></P>

Value-dependent address of static data member of class template
</H4><B>Section: </B>14.6.2.3&#160; [temp.dep.constexpr]

<P>According to bullet 2.4 of 14.6.2.3 [temp.dep.constexpr], an
<I>id-expression</I> is value-dependent if</P>

<UL><LI><P>it names a static data member that is a dependent
member of the current instantiation and is not initialized
in a <I>member-declarator</I>,</P></LI></UL>

<P>This implies that the address of an initialized static data
member is not value-dependent, which is incorrect.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (June, 2016):</B></P>

<P>Change 14.6.2.3 [temp.dep.constexpr] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>
