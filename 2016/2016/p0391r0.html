<h1>P0391R0: Introducing the term "templated entity"</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In turns out that the resolution for a number of core issues would
benefit from introducing the term "templated entity".  Because of its
general usefulness, it was factored into a separate paper.
Integrating it into any single core issue resolution risks further
postponement and causes ensuing ripple effects for other core issues
if the particular core issue is held up for unrelated reasons.


<h2>Wording</h2>

Add a new paragraph before clause 14 [temp] paragraph 6:

<blockquote class="new">

  A <em>templated entity</em> is

<ul>
<li>a template,</li>

<li>an entity defined (3.1 basic.def) or created (12.2
class.temporary) in a templated entity,</li>

<li>a member of a templated entity,</li>

<li>an enumerator for an enumeration that is a templated entity, or

<li>the closure type of a <em>lambda-expression</em> (5.1.2
[expr.prim.lambda]) appearing in the declaration of a templated
entity.

</li></ul>

[ Note: A local class, a local variable, or a friend function
defined in a templated entity is a templated entity. ]
