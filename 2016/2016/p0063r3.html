  <h1>C++17 should refer to C11 instead of C99</h1>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This document is a follow-on to
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0063r0.html">P0063R0</a>,
    from the pre-Kona mailing.
    It goes into the details of the &ldquo;easy part&rdquo;
    described therein.
    Much of its rationale is not repeated here.</p>
  <p class="new">It has also been revised
    as a result of LEWG review in Jacksonville.
    Changes from R1 are boxed.</p>
  <h2>Signal handler restrictions</h2>
  <p>18.10p10 effectively says that a signal handler
    must be written in the common subset of C and C++.
    But C++ and C11 both have thread-local storage.
    Referencing C11 instead of C99 might be taken to suggest
    that it would be OK for a signal handler to reference
    a thread-local object.</p>
  <p>It turns out that there is a technicality/loophole
    by which this can be dodged.
    Because the associated keyword is spelled differently
    in C and C++, technically thread-local storage
    is not actually in the common subset of the two languages &ndash;
    even though both languages support the feature.</p>
  <p>While this state would not provide
    a satisfying long-term resolution,
    it is considered adequate to separate
    the deep technical issues of signal handlers
    from the broader, more editorial issues
    of updating the normative reference.
    Hans has written <a href="p0063r3.html#p0270">P0270</a>
    to address signal handlers.</p>
  <p>This document also doesn't go into interoperability
    of threads or atomics
    in a mixed C/C++ program.</p>
  <h2>Header coverage</h2>
  <p>C11 made the <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> header optional.
    Currently in C++, the <code>&lt;ccomplex&gt;</code> header
    maps directly to the <code>&lt;complex&gt;</code> header.
    Simply deleting the requirement
    for a <code>&lt;ccomplex&gt;</code> header
    is simpler, and may be better, than making it optional.
    Of course an implementation would not need to change
    in order to conform to the new state of affairs,
    but programs that use <code>&lt;ccomplex&gt;</code>
    instead of <code>&lt;complex&gt;</code>
    would cease to be strictly conforming.</p>
  <p>C11 also added five new headers:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><code>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code></dt>
    <dt><code>&lt;threads.h&gt;</code></dt>
    <dd>These are also optional in C11,
      and since their functionality is already provided in C++ by other means,
      it's not clear that inventing optional wrappers for them
      would be worth the effort.</dd>
    <dt><code>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</code></dt>
    <dt><code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code></dt>
    <dd>C++ already covers these two,
      having inherited one of them from the C Unicode TR
      (later incorporated into C11),
      and having effectively jumped the gun on the other one.</dd>
    <dt><code>&lt;stdnoreturn.h&gt;</code></dt>
    <dd>All this provides is a single prettifying macro:
      <pre>#define noreturn _Noreturn</pre>
      In C++, <code>[[noreturn]]</code>
      is probably already considered pretty enough.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>So it's not clear that C++ needs to add anything
    for any of these new headers.</p>
  <p class="new">LEWG decided
    that <code>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;stdnoreturn.h&gt;</code>
    and <code>&lt;threads.h&gt;</code>
    should all be ignored &ndash;
    except that there should be a footnote pointing out
    that their omission is intentional.</p>
  <p class="new">It was also decided that the existing headers
    <code>&lt;ccomplex&gt;</code>
    and <code>&lt;ctgmath&gt;</code>
    should be deprecated.
    <code>&lt;ciso646&gt;</code>
    was called out as explicitly having no effect
    according to the standard,
    but apparently the real world is not so simple.
    <code>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</code>
    and 
    <code>&lt;cstdbool&gt;</code>
    were mentioned as also being pointless in C++,
    but were not the subject of any straw poll;
    I have taken the liberty of assuming
    that perhaps they should be deprecated as well.</p>
  <h2>Annex K &emsp; Bounds checking interfaces</h2>
  <p>C11 optionally added several dozen new functions
    to the standard library,
    as safer alternatives to existing standard C library functions.
    For example, <code>strcat_s</code> was added as an alternative to
    <code>strcat</code>.</p>
  <p>The declarations of these functions
    were added to existing headers;
    backward compatibility was provided
    by requiring that they be controlled by the setting of a macro:
    <code>__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__</code>.
    A program can suppress them by defining the macro to zero,
    or request them by defining the macro to one.
    Whether they are declared if the macro is not defined
    by the program is implementation-defined.</p>
  <p>At a recent WG14 meeting,
    a proposal was considered
    (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1967.htm">N1967</a>)
    that these functions should be removed
    from a future revision of the standard.</p>
  <p class="new">LEWG decided that these functions
    should not be imported into the <code>std</code> namespace,
    but that it should be entirely implementation-defined
    whether they are declared in the global namespace.
    (Any implementation can document
    that it does the full &ldquo;macro dance&rdquo;
    described by the C standard.)</p>
  <h2>Working draft changes</h2>
  <h3>1.2 &emsp; Normative references</h3>
  <p>Change paragraph 1:</p>
  <blockquote>

	to support new character data types</em></del></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Change paragraph 2:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The library described in Clause 7
      of ISO/IEC 9899:<del>1999</del><ins>2011</ins>
      <del>and Clause 7 of ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.1:2001
	and Clause 7 of ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.2:2003</del>
      is hereinafter called
	the <dfn>C standard library</dfn>.<sup>1</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Delete paragraph 3:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><del>The library described in ISO/IEC TR 19769:2004
      is hereinafter called the <dfn>C Unicode TR</dfn>.</del></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>17.5.1.5 &emsp; C Library</h3>
  <p>Change paragraph 1:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="new">Paragraphs labeled &ldquo;See also:&rdquo;
      contain cross-references to the relevant portions
      of this International Standard
      and the ISO C standard<del>,
      which is incorporated into this International Standard
      by reference</del>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>17.5.2.1.4 &emsp; Character sequences</h3>
  <p>Delete footnote 167, associated with paragraph 1, bullet 1:</p>
  <blockquote class="new">
    <ul>
      <li>A <dfn>letter</dfn> is any of the 26 lowercase or 26 uppercase letters in the basic execution character set.<del><sup>167</sup></del></li>
    </ul>
    <p><del>167) Note that this definition differs
      from the definition in ISO C 7.1.1.</del></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Apparently there was a time
    when the definition of &ldquo;letter&rdquo;
    also included the underscore,
    but that is no longer the case.</p>
  <h3>17.6.1.2 &emsp; Headers</h3>
  <p>Add a footnote to paragraph 3:</p>
  <blockquote class="new">
    <p>The facilities of the C standard Library are provided in 26 additional headers, as shown in Table 15.<ins><sup><var>N</var>)</sup></ins></p>
    <p><ins><var>N</var>) It is intentional
      that there is no C++ header for any of
      these C headers: <code>&lt;stdatomic.h></code>,
      <code>&lt;stdnoreturn.h></code>, 
      <code>&lt;threads.h></code>.</ins></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Change paragraph 4:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Except as noted in Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D,
      the contents of each header <code>c</code><var>name</var>
      shall be the same as that of the corresponding header
      <var>name</var><code>.h</code>,
      as specified in the C standard library (1.2)
      <del>or the C Unicode TR, as appropriate,</del>
      as if by inclusion.
      In the C++ standard library, however,
      the declarations
      (except for names which are defined as macros in C)
      are within namespace scope (3.3.6)
      of the namespace <code>std</code>.
      It is unspecified whether these names
      (including any overloads added
      in Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D)
      are first declared within the global namespace scope
      and are then injected into namespace <code>std</code>
      by explicit <var>using-declarations</var> (7.3.3).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Add new paragraphs, and table, following paragraph 8:</p>
  <blockquote class="new">
    <p><ins>Annex K of the C standard
      describes a large number of functions,
      with associated types and macros,
      which &ldquo;promote safer, more secure programming&rdquo;
      than many of the traditional C library functions.
      The names of the functions
      have a suffix of <code>_s</code>;
      most of them provide the same service as the C library function
      with the unsuffixed name,
      but generally take an additional argument
      whose value is the size of the result array.
      If any C++ header is included,
      it is implementation-defined
      whether any of these names is declared
      in the global namespace.

      in namespace <code>std</code>.)</ins></p>
    <p><ins>Table <var>N</var> lists the Annex K names
