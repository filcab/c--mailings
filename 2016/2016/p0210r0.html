    <h2 id="motivation">Summary</h2>

    <p><strong>Short form.</strong> We propose a light-weight, dynamic array which is in every
    aspect identical to <code>std::vector&lt;T, A&gt;</code> except that it does not allow
    efficient size-changing operations. For many use cases, the two containers can be used
    interchangeably, but the light-weight container will typically only consume 2/3 of the space
    of a vector, since it does not need to keep track of a capacity separately from the size. In
    other words, it is just like <code>std::vector&lt;T, A&gt;</code> with the following
    modifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No <code>insert</code>, <code>push_back</code>, <code>emplace{,_back}</code>, <code>erase</code>.</li>
      <li>No <code>reserve</code>, <code>capacity</code>.
      <li><code>resize(n)</code> always reallocates unless <code>n == size()</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bike shed: what is it called?</strong> The first obvious problem is how to name
    this container. Names like <code>flexible_array</code> or <code>flarray</code> seem unwieldy,
    <code>small_vector</code> suggests <abbr title="small string optimisation">SSO</abbr>-like
    optimisations, <code>vlarray</code> is too much like <abbr title="variable-length array">VLA</abbr>
    or valarray, and <code>dyn_array</code> is too close to <code>dynarray</code>. As a
    placeholder we use &ldquo;<code>compact_vector</code>&rdquo; for now, with the understanding
    that this will need to be revised. We are open to suggestions.</p>

    <p><strong>What this proposal is not:</strong> A preliminary discussion on the reflector
    showed that a lot of people have specific expectations, desires and goals in this design
    space. We would like to establish clear boundaries for this proposal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a proposal for a fixed-size array. The proposed container can be resized.</li>
      <li>Not a proposal for an unmovable array. The proposed container can be moved and swapped
        as usual.</li>
      <li>Not a proposal for &ldquo;stack-allocation optimisation&rdquo;. The proposed container
        is an ordinary, dynamic container that uses an allocator to obtain storage.</li>
      <li>Not a fix or revival of <code>std::dynarray</code>. This proposal does not share the
        goals of <code>dynarray</code>, and it comes with its own motivation and rationale.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>First and foremost we would like this proposal to be considered in isolation and on its
    own merits. We will gladly work on unification and harmonising with the authors of any other
    paper in this design space that LEWG finds desirable, once that time comes.</p>

    <p><strong>Long rationale.</strong> The author considers dynamic arrays (i.e. <code>new
    T[n]()</code>) a misfeature of the language (see the <a href="p0210r0.html#appendix">appendix</a> for a
    summary of its failings). In almost every way, one may replace such a dynamic array with
    <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;(n)</code>, except for the undeniable fact that a vector is
    larger. While we already need to store and communicate the size of a dynamic array in order
    to use it safely, there is generally no reason for the cost of keeping a separate capacity
    counter around. Until now, the library has been missing a simpler dynamic container that
    meets precisely, and without the cost of unwanted generality, those needs which currently
    call for dynamic arrays.</p>

    <p><strong>The solution.</strong> We propose a new container class template, for now and for
    exposition only referred to as <code>compact_vector</code>, which is in every aspect like
    <code>std::vector</code>, except that it does not have growing insertion operations,
    shrinking erasure operations, or a notion of capacity. Note in particular that we still
    have <code>resize()</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Example.</strong></p>
    <div class="code">compact_vector&lt;compact_vector&lt;short&gt;&gt; v(1000000);

      for (auto &amp; x : v) {
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x.resize(make_number(), make_default_value());
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process(x.begin(), x.end());
      }
    </div>
    <p>Using a <code>vector&lt;short&gt;</code> instead of
    <code>compact_vector&lt;short&gt;</code> would require a million unused additional
    capacity pointers. If the size of each <code>v[i]</code> is small, this may well be
    a non-trivial cost which the proposed container avoids.</p>

    <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

    <p>This is a pure library extension.</p>

      };</div>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The two-iterator constructor and the two-iterator overload of <code>assign</code>
        require forward iterators (so as to be able to precompute the size).</li>
      <li>The explicit conversion to vector is a stealing conversion; we expect
        <code>compact_vector</code> to be implemented in such a fashion that the allocated
        storage can be transplanted into a <code>vector</code> with the same template
        arguments. Note that we do <em>not</em> have the opposite operation, stealing
        <em>from</em> a vector. To do so we would require a vector whose size is equal to its
        capacity, which cannot be achieved portably. This would be nice to have in the
        future, since it would allow using a <code>vector</code> as a &ldquo;builder&rdquo;
        for a &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; <code>compact_vector</code>.</li>
      <li>Iterators and references remain valid unless a <code>resize</code> function is called
        with <code>n != size()</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

    <p>We can replace uses of <code>new T[n]()</code> and most uses of <code>new T[n]</code> with
      <code>compact_vector&lt;T&gt;(n)</code>. The only feature that we deliberately choose not
      to provide is uninitialised storage, like <code>new char[n]</code>. User code benefits
      from uninitialised allocations (and this is a real use case!), but it requires cooperation
      from the user for correctness. Users requiring uninitialised storage can resort to
      <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;char[]&gt;(new char[n])</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="appendix1">Appendix I: What&rsquo;s wrong with dynamic arrays?</h2>

    <p>Dynamic arrays, i.e. arrays created via either <code>new T[n]</code> or some placement variant
    thereof, are an odd-man-out in many regards. We will enumerate a few.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic arrays cannot be used independently of their value without separately
        communicating their size, which needs to be captured somewhere else explicitly at the
        time of construction of the array. Yet the size also needs to be stored internally in
        the implementation to allow for destructor calls. The former violates encapsulation,
        the latter economy.</li>
      <li>Dynamic arrays are the <em>only</em> part of C++ in which truly dynamic typing
        happens: An object is created whose type is not known statically, and there is not even
        an expression whose value is that object. This is weird. (By contrast, <code>Base * p =
        new Derived</code> does at least contain an expression with which one might statically
        derive a description of the created object, even though that code snippet does not
        capture it.)</li>
      <li>Dynamic arrays cannot be constructed and destroyed like normal objects: <code>new
        T</code> means something surprising when <code>T</code> is an array type, and
        <code>p-&gt;~T()</code> is ill-formed. This means, for example, that there is no
        straightforward notion of an <code>allocate_shared</code> for a shared pointer
        to an array; rather, we have a sequence of elements under shared ownership which
        are destroyed by a hand-crafted deleter that destroys array <em>elements</em>.</li>
      <li>Dynamic arrays have repeatedly been the subject of arcane standard defects. The
        inability to use array-placement-new on account of unknowable overhead (&ldquo;<code>+
        y</code>&rdquo;) remains unresolved (cf. <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg476">CWG 476</a>,
        <a href="http://wg21.link/ewg68">EWG 68</a>).</li>
      <li>Dynamic arrays generally conflate the two responsibilities of memory allocation and
        object construction. The library&rsquo;s pervasive use of allocators to create memory
        and objects separately, one-by-one under the control of the user, has been demonstrated
        as the superior way to manage collections of objects. Hundreds of student hours spent on
        implementing Baby&rsquo;s First Vector by starting with <code>T * ptr = new T[n];</code>
        have shown the general confusion between something that is empty and something which
        consists of <code>n</code> default-constructed objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="appendix2">Appendix II: Early feedback</h2>

    <p>A draft of this paper was circulated on the LEWG reflector for early feedback. Here are
    some arbitrarily selected responses.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many people are indifferent towards this proposal. There is a trade-off between adding
      more library types and the benefits of having a perfect fit for this particular use case.</li>
      <li>Herb Sutter suggested that the C++ Core Guidelines are <a
      href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#gslowner-ownership-pointers">looking
      for a type like this</a>, for the same reasons: To replace array-<code>new</code>.</li>
      <li>Several people suggested that their users are interested in stack optimisations, not this.</li>
      <li>There were suggestions that SG14 may be interested.</li>
    </ul>
