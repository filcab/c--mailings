<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document is a revision of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0108r0.html">P0108R0</a>
based on discussions
in the SG1 study group in October 2015 in Kona.
P0108R0 was in turn a follow-on to
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4376.html">N4376</a>,
and provides an initial description of a potential solution to the TLS
problem statement implied by that document.

<h2>Summary of Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
We expect that lightweight executors will have problems
with TLS as currently envisioned and implemented.
For example, some types of executors nest hierarchically, so that
a number of light-weight executors might run in the context of
a single heavy-weight <tt>std::thread</tt>.
If a given function accesses TLS, and is called both from the context
of a <tt>std::thread</tt> and from the context of a task executing
within an <tt>std::thread</tt>, what should its TLS accesses do?
If the instances invoked from a task access task-level TLS data,
the function must do different things when invoked in different contexts.
If the <tt>std::thread</tt>-level TLS data is accesses, then the
task-level accesses might introduce data races and thus undefined behavior.

<p>
This also can interact with signal handling.
To see this, suppose that a signal arrives at a
<tt>std::thread</tt> while that <tt>std::thread</tt>
is running a light-weight executor, for example, a task.
The signal handler will likely conceptually be part of the
<tt>std::thread</tt> rather than the task.
This would imply some additional context switching at signal-handler
start and end.

<p>
TLS is most especially a problem for light-weight executors
implementing same-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) units
and general-purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs)
because large programs can have very large amounts of TLS data,
each item of which might have C++ constructors and destructors.
Spending many milliseconds to run constructors and destructors
for a SIMD computation that only takes a few microseconds to run
is clearly not a reasonably way to achieve high performance.
The use of lazy construction reduces this overhead, but the
occasional &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; taken from processing to
run some constructor might be quite unwelcome.

<p>
GPGPU code often has longer runtimes, but they also tend to run
extremely large numbers of threads, adding a memory-footprint
problem to the constructor-destructor overhead problem.
To make matters worse, in some environments, the constructors and
destructors must be run on heavyweight CPUs rather than on the
lightweight GPGPU hardware threads, which severely restricts the
computational resources that can be applied to run constructors
and destructors for GPGPU TLS data.

<p>
At the source-code level, it isn't generally knowable which executor a
function is called from, or even if a function is called from multiple
executors.
It is left up to the programmer to write code which correctly
accesses state for the executor(s) that the code will execute in.
(In theory, we could of course use a TLS variable to record what type
of executor was currently executing, but in practice that of course
requires a TLS implementation that is efficient enough to be used by
light-weight executors, and if we had that, we wouldn't be writing
this paper.)

<h2>Tentative Goals</h2>

<p>
There are a number of possible ways of resolving this issue, as discussed in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4376.html">N4376</a>,
however, this paper focuses on the possibility that TLS is an optional component
of an executor.  With this approach, <tt>std::thread</tt> implements TLS, but
lighter-weight executors might choose not to.

At a minimum developers intending to target lighter-weight executors may choose
to author code which doesn't use TLS, thereby avoiding performance pitfalls or
lack of support on those executors. The current Standard Library unfortunately
implicitly uses TLS in a variety of places, making TLS avoidance difficult.

<p>
For this approach, we put forward the following tentative goals:

<ol>
<li>	Make TLS availability optional for light-weight executors,
	as noted above.
	<ol>
	<li> Provide new Standard Library functionality which avoids using TLS.
	<li> Offer a clear migration path from older versions of these library
	APIs.
	<li> Maintain the performance and scalability of high-quality
	standard-library implementations.
	</ol>
<li>	Avoid source-code changes for existing code running in
	existing executors (such as <tt>std::thread</tt>) that
	provide TLS.
<li>	Avoid the need to recompile existing code running in
	existing executors (such as <tt>std::thread</tt>) that
	provide TLS.
<li>	Recruit sanitizer developers to help identify issues in
	new code and in standard-library code related to this change.
</ol>

<p>
The next section exercises these goals by attempting to apply them
to the TLS <tt>errno</tt> facility as used by the standard math library,
in the hope of sparking productive discussion.
Note that when multiple lightweight executors run concurrently in the
context of a single <tt>std::thread</tt>, setting <tt>errno</tt>
implicitly (and for some, surprisingly) invokes
undefined behavior, so a fix is a matter of some importance.
At a minimum, lightweight executors that do not support TLS need to
state that attempts to access TLS results in undefined behavior.

<h2>The Curious Case of <tt>errno</tt> and the Standard Math Library</h2>

<p>
C++ provides a per-<tt>std::thread</tt> facility named <tt>errno</tt> (19.4) in
order to provide POSIX compatibility.  This is also required to allow C++'s
standard math library (26) maintain compatibility with that of C.  Section 7.12
of the C standard specifies that <tt>math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO</tt>
being non-zero indicates that certain errors are available via <tt>errno</tt>.
Furthermore, Section 19.4 of the C++ standard specifies that <tt>errno</tt> is
provided on a per-thread basis.  Therefore, <tt>errno</tt> is frequently
implemented using TLS, which in turn means that the math library's use
of <tt>errno</tt> forms an excellent initial test case for changes to TLS.

<h3>Preferred Approach: <tt>status_value</tt></h3>

<p>
The preferred approach is to provide alternative wrappers for the functions in a
new namespace, so that <tt>errno</tt>-oblivious code could simply assign the
return value to a variable, relying on user-defined conversions to take up the
slack.  The hope is that LEWG's
proposed <a href="p0262r0.html"><tt>status_value</tt></a>
can serve this purpose, since it would make math functions look the same as
other APIs being considered for inclusion in the Standard.


<p>
To truly "feel" the same as current <tt>errno</tt>-using math functions,
the <tt>status_value</tt> class would need to be extended with an implicit
conversion to return its <tt>Value</tt>, which we'll suggest to LEWG. It was
also suggested that floating-point math functions could store their error status
using <tt>NaN</tt> bits, which the current <tt>status_value</tt> design forbids
(it must be able to hold both a status <em>and</em> a value).

<p>
Code sensitive to <tt>errno</tt> could assign the return value to
a <tt>status_value</tt> and then extract both the <tt>errno</tt> and the return
value.

<p>
This approach allows <tt>errno</tt>-ignoring code to run safely in light-weight
executors, with modest changes for code that pays attention to <tt>errno</tt>.
One way of preventing silent miscomputation by <tt>errno</tt>-ignoring code
is to use exceptions, which <tt>status_value</tt> also supports.

<h3>Alternative Approach: <tt>math_result</tt></h3>

<p>
If adding an implicit convertion to <tt>status_value</tt> to return
its <tt>Value</tt> proves infeasible, it is of course easy to create a return
type solely for the use of the math library.  We expect LEWG to provide guidance
in this area. The following fanciful code defines a new <tt>class
math_result</tt> for this purpose:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 namespace std {
 2 namespace experimental {
 3
 4 enum class math_error {
 5   divide_by_zero,
 6   inexact,
 7   overflow,
 8   underflow,
 9   invalid,
10   // ...
11 };
12
13 template &lt;typename T&gt;
14 class math_result {
15   math_error e;
16   T val;
17
18  public:
19   explicit operator math_error() const { return e; }
20   operator T() const { return val; }
21 };
22
23 math_result&lt;float&gt; tgamma(float x) {
24   math_result&lt;float&gt; ret;
25
26   ret.val = tgammaf(x , &amp;ret.e);
27   return ret;
28 }
29
30 math_result&lt;double&gt; tgamma(double x) {
31   math_result&lt;double&gt; ret;
32
33   ret.val = tgamma(x, &amp;ret.e);
34   return ret;
35 }
36
37 }  // namespace experimental
38
39 template &lt;&gt;
40 struct is_error_code_enum&lt;experimental::math_error&gt; : std::true_type {};
41
42 }  // namespace std
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Paths Not Taken</h2>

<p>
The following sections serve as tombstones for approaches described
in earlier versions of this paper that are now deprecated.

<ol>
<li>	Restricting configuration.
<li>	Adding <tt>errno</tt> parameter via function overloading.
<li>	Limit TLS via a class-hierarchy-like approach.
<li>	Use IEEE NaNs or other machine state to record errors.
</ol>

<h3>Restricting Configuration</h3>

<p>
One approach is to require that <tt>math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT</tt>
be non-zero (as is required for IEC 60559) and that <tt>math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO</tt> be zero in all cases where math library functions are invoked
from executors that do not provide TLS.  Note that <tt>math_errhandling</tt> is
global and constant, which means that it cannot have different values in
different contexts of the same execution.  However, this approach cannot be used
in conjunction with existing code that invokes math functions and
tests <tt>errno</tt>.  This could in turn be dealt with by forbidding use of
code that checks for math errors using <tt>errno</tt>, but this would have the
undesirable effect of acting as a barrier to the adoption of light-weight
executors.  It also makes it difficults to check for math errors at all.

<h3>Adding <tt>errno</tt> Parameter Via Function Overloading</h3>

<p>
Another approach is to use function overloading, so that an additional
<tt>double sqrt(double, int *)</tt> declaration could be used in
light-weight executors.
Note that in some implementations this could require modifying the
underlying C library in order to bypass <tt>errno</tt> setting.
Code invoked both from light-weight and heavy-weight executors would
need to use the new delaration, but code invoked only from
heavy-weight executors could continue using the old API, consistent
with the goals preserving existing source and binary code.
It is tempting to instead overload on the return value, but C++
of course does not support this notion.
A (probably partial) list of new APIs is as follows:

</ul>

<p>
Note that new APIs need be provided only for those math functions that
set <tt>errno</tt>.
Note also that because C does not provide function overloading,
different names will need to be used should C adopt similar functionality.

<p>One might expect some dissatisfaction with the invention of more than
100 new functions, especially given that a great many uses of these functions
ignore <tt>errno</tt>.
Although one can argue that ignoring <tt>errno</tt> is a bad idea,
one might also expect strenuous objections to pointless modifications
of existing <tt>errno</tt>-ignoring code.

<h3>Machine Registers: The Ultimate TLS Implementation</h3>

<p>
The logically extreme TLS implementation is a reserved machine register,
so extreme <tt>errno</tt> would simply reserve a register for <tt>errno</tt>.
If common code was to be invoked from both light-weight and heavy-weight
executors, a simple solution is to always reserve a register for
<tt>errno</tt>.

<p>
Of course, this approach simply does not scale with increasing numbers
of TLS objects, as even modern machines
have a rather limited number of registers.
In addition, some TLS constructors might not react well to finding that
all of their data was in machine registers, especially those constructors
expecting to create linked structures.
Neverthless, this approach might work well for restricted quantities of
TLS data, such as that which might be needed for a non-hosted small-library
implementation.

<h3>Applying Lessons from Class Hierarchies</h3>

<p>
Suppose that we (very loosely) modeled TLS data with a class-like
hierarchy.
The &ldquo;base class&rdquo; would contain only that TLS data required by the
core language, and &ldquo;subclasses&rdquo; would add TLS data required by
libraries and by the user application.
Ignoring the analogies with abstract classes for the moment, light-weight
executors might confine themselves to TLS data relatively high up in
this TLS hierarchy, while heavy-weight executors might take the entire
class hierarchy, lock, stock, and barrel.

<p>
Any executor expecting to use the math library would need to maintain
that part of the TLS hierarchy containing <tt>errno</tt>.
Future work might identify a minimum subset for various types of
executors.

<h3>Use Hardware State (NaNs) to Record Errors</h3>

<p>
IEEE floating-point not-a-number (NaN) values were designed to
record error conditions and to flow them through the remainder of the
computation.
Non-IEEE hardware often has other facilities for this purpose,
and some IEEE hardware has cheaper ways to maintain this information.

<p>
The key point here is to provide an API to read this information out.
The API must take a floating-point number as input for the NaN case,
however, implementations that do not use NaNs are free to ignore
this number and instead read out hardware state.
The return value is an integer <tt>errno</tt>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 int recent_errno(float x);
 2 int recent_errno(double x);
 3 int recent_errno(long double x);
 4
 5 extern "C" {
 6   int recent_fp_errno(float x);
 7   int recent_dp_errno(double x);
 8   int recent_ldp_errno(long double x);
 9 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This approach only applies to functions that return a floating-point
number.
Functions that return integral types (integer log functions and
round-to-integer functions) must use some other alternative to stop
using <tt>errno</tt>.

<p>
Note that NaNs can be used, if desired, in conjunction with either
the preferred <tt>status_value</tt> approach or the alternative
<tt>math_result</tt> approach.

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>
Floating-point state is stored on a per-thread basis, which means that
if a light-weight executor can be preempted or migrated among
<tt>std::thread</tt> instance, things like rounding modes and
error/exception indications can be subject to unscheduled revision.
