<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  This paper is a response to P0225R0, "Why I want Concepts, and why I want them
  sooner rather than later."<sup><a href="p0240r0.html#References_P0225R0">[1]</a></sup>
  The author presents an opinionated view, though with the opposing perspective --
  that Concepts is not yet ready for C++ and that it would be a mistake to prematurely include
  it as a part of C++17.

<a name="InBrief"><h2>In brief</h2></a>
<p>
  For over a decade, people have investigated bringing direct, language-level
  support for generic programming to C++. We've seen multiple
  approaches that have been able to directly represent differing subsets
  of the vocabulary of the paradigm. Most recently, with the Concepts TS, we
  have an approach that represents constraints via usage patterns, and provides
  concept-based overloading.
</p>
<p>
  However, what is currently provided by the Concepts TS is not complete. First,
  as has been pointed out by P0225R0, we do not yet have a conceptified version
  of the standard library. Unlike P0225R0, however, I do <i>not</i> consider this
  something that can be written off. Having a conceptified standard library is
  important not just to prove out the feature, but also to serve as an example
  to C++ developers as to how Concepts should be used, down to the subtleties
  that are undoubtedly required by the standard library. As well, if we fail
  to ship a conceptified standard library with the initial integration of
  Concepts into C++, we will likely see common concepts that the standard
  library should provide being invented and reinvented with varying levels of
  quality by various development teams. This is not something that we should
  be inviting.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to this, there is one feature that many (though admittedly not
  all) generic programmers, feel is extremely important to any Concept
  implementation, and yet is currently left out. That feature is the ability for a
  constrained template to automatically and immediately validate its definition
  at the time of writing, prior to instantiation, by verifying that the body
  only uses functionality that is allowed by the constraints, thereby making
  sure that the writer of the template neither accidentally uses functionality
  outside of its specified constraints, nor accidentally under-constrains their
  template. Without this feature, constraints provide a mostly superficial
  advantage over existing techniques, even though those superficial changes are,
  as Ville has put it, "alluring."
</p>
<p>
  A lack of a feature in other contexts is not normally a problem -- we can
  usually just add a missing feature in a future standard with little or no
  harm done. However, with respect to the checking of constrained template
  definitions, there is strong reason to believe that it would not be possible
  to add definition checking to Concepts in a way that is meaningful without
  serious breaking changes. The reliability of the checking of definitions in
  C++0x concepts, which notably had a working implementation that included
  definition checking by way of ConceptGCC, stemmed from the fine-grained and
  restricted way of specifying requirements through pseudo-signatures, the
  restriction of definitions to only directly viewing the result and parameter
  types of those pseudo-signatures, and the fact that name lookup within a
  constrained template was modified to match the constraints such that the
  associated functions of the concepts involved were discovered and preferred.<sup><a href="p0240r0.html#References_N1848">[2]</a></sup>
  These latter points are essential in preventing errors during instantiation and
  as a means to provide consistency of lookup of associated functions. Further,
  during the implementation of a constrained standard library for C++0x, it was
  discovered that most constraints that were declared were actually incorrect in
  very subtle ways, despite the fact that those constraints were written by experts.
</p>
<p>
  For the above reasons, it is very difficult to imagine that the average
  programmer will be able to correctly write constraints without aid. In addition,
  it is likely that if we eventually do get definition checking, name lookup within
  constrained templates would have to change, breaking existing code considerably
  even if the developer managed to write a constraint that was truly correct. This
  is the unfortunate reality.</p>
<p>
  In a very recent correspondence with Doug Gregor, one of the principle people behind
  C++0x concepts and the primary developer of ConceptGCC, I asked him for his own
  perspective on this issue. The following was his response, quoted with permission:
</p>
<p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
        <span class="quote">
<p>&#8220;I am completely convinced that putting concepts into the C++ standard without separate type checking of template definitions means that we will never get separate type checking of template definitions in standard C++. Within a close approximation, all of the constrained templates written before that point will have incorrect or incomplete requirements, leaving no path forward except to having two constraint systems. Moreover, it's extremely likely that the design of concepts does not admit separate type checking of template definitions in any real way (despite inevitable protests to the contrary).&#8221;</p></span>

<a name="WhoIAm"><h2>Who I am</h2></a>
 <p>
  For some context as to why I consider myself qualified to make the assessments in
  this paper -- I have been programming in C++ for about 15 years and have been an
  active member of the Boost community since around 2004. Specifically, I write a lot
  of code using the generic programming paradigm. My most relevant experience to the topic at hand is that I have
  worked with C++0x concepts prior to them being pulled from C++11 and implemented an
  EDSL<sup><a href="p0240r0.html#References_Gem">[3]</a></sup> in standard C++ for directly representing and checking the concepts that were
  presented in the last working paper that contained C++0x concepts, N2914<sup><a href="p0240r0.html#References_N2914">[4]</a></sup>. I am
  knowledgeable of many of the subtleties of concepts as a language feature, including what
  is necessary for meaningful checking of constrained template definitions.</p>
<p>Though I have a solid understanding of previous efforts, I was never, myself, involved with
  any of its associated proposals. While I am skeptical regarding certain aspects of
  the Concepts TS, I am fairly removed from the controversy surrounding the pulling
  of concepts from C++11 and the move towards the current effort. My views are my own
  conclusions that I've come to as an observer over the course of many years. I have
  profound respect for all people involved with the various attempts to bring more
  direct support for the generic programming paradigm to C++, though I do have serious
  concerns about the current state of the Concepts TS that make me worried about its
  potential inclusion in C++17.
 </p>

<a name="Confusion"><h2>Do we care about checking constrained-template definitions?</h2></a>
<p>
 Though P0225R0 defends the inclusion of Concepts in C++ even without standard library
 support, which is something I strongly disagree with, my main concern is that the
 current specification likely rules out us ever getting the checking of constrained
 template definitions in the language, short of deprecating Concepts and reintroducing
 a new facility that is properly suited for the task at some point considerably further
 in the future than the standard after C++17. Because of this, before considering
 Concepts for inclusion in C++17, we should first be sure that everyone is either
 aware of the very real likelihood of the Concepts TS being unsatisfactory for definition
 checking, or the community needs to decide once and for all that definition checking isn't important and
 that we are willing to sacrifice it in order to get concepts into the language a couple
  of years early.</p>

 <p>Upon speaking with various C++ developers who are interested in generic programming
 informally, both inside and outside of the committee, I've discovered that people
 fall into one of a few categories:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Those who want concepts as a language feature and consider definition checking to be important, with the impression that definition checking will be able to come without significantly modifying or redesigning Concepts</li>
  <li>Those who want concepts as a language feature and consider definition checking to be important, with the belief that Concepts as-is is not suitable for definition checking</li>
  <li>Those who want concepts as a language feature and don't consider definition checking to be important</li>
  <li>Those who do not care about concepts as a language feature</li>  
 </ul>

 <p>Of the above list, the most troubling thing to me is (anecdotally) how many people
 fall into the first category, despite the fact that some of those who understand the
 issues, including a chief driver of C++0x concepts and the implementor of ConceptGCC,
 have explicitly stated that they do not see the current Concepts TS as being at all
 capable of providing proper definition checking. At the very least, before considering
 Concepts for inclusion in C++17, that issue needs to be resolved. People need to be
 fully aware of what it is they are getting and what it is they are likely ruling out if they
 are expected to make an informed decision.</p>

 <p><i>While I personally feel that definition checking is extremely
 important, as do others, there are also notable people in the generic programming
 community who do not consider it quite so important and are willing to sacrifice the
 chance of us ever getting it.</i></p>

<a name="Errors"><h2>Complicated template errors will remain if we do not get definition checking</h2></a>
<p>
  One of the goals of a concepts language feature is to reduce or eliminate those verbose
  template instantiation backtraces that we all know and love when we encounter a compile error
  as a part of a template library. The Concepts TS helps with one side of this problem
  by making it easier to specify constraints at the interface level, but much of the
  problem still remains. Keep in mind that for years we've had access to SFINAE exploits
  that allow such checks, and even when they are used by the "too clever" programmer,
  as Ville refers to them, crazy template errors still remain when in the body of a
  constrained template. Whether those constraints are specified with SFINAE explicitly
  or via concepts without definition checking cannot considerably change that.
</p>
<p>This is true for a number of reasons. First, when a programmer developing generic code
gets constraints incorrect, it is the user of that template who suffers, as they will once
again see a horrible template backtrace at the time they "correctly" use the template (correctly
in the sense that they met the specified requirements). Additionally, even if the constraints
are specified correctly, actually writing a template in a way that strictly uses the
functionality specified in the constraints in a meaningful way is <i>incredibly</i> subtle.
In practice, this means explicitly casting results of associated functions and also invoking
those functions through traits and qualified calls and generally avoiding direct use of ADL.</p>

<a name="DefinitionChecking"><h2>Writing constrained templates is exceedingly difficult</h2></a>
<p>
 Writing constraints is difficult -- so difficult that even experts fail
 to properly specify constraints. Again, quoting a recent conversation with Doug Gregor,
 regarding the conceptification of the standard library for C++0x:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
        <span class="quote">
<p>&#8220;&hellip;when we added type checking of template definitions, there was a *huge* reckoning in the implementation of the concepts-based standard library. Only the most trivial constrained function templates had a correct set of requirements. Most had missing requirements of some form or other. We had that reckoning before putting forward serious proposals for a concept-based standard library, so it happened mostly outside of the committee process.&#8221;</p></span>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>-- Doug Gregor</em></span>
      </p></blockquote></div>

<p>If we are to be concerned with writing <i>correct</i>
 generic code, and not just code that provides some superficial advantages over
 SFINAE and tag-dispatch (though that is also important), then we really do need
 definition checking. Given that even experts have trouble correctly specifying seemingly simple
  constraints, I do not think it is wise to assume that the average programmer is
  capable of doing so, regardless of confidence and the illusion of it occasionally being
  trivial. Definition checking is important to experienced generic programmers and to newcomers
  alike.
 </p>
<a name="Why"><h2>It is unlikely that the Concepts TS as-is will be able to do definition checking</h2></a>
<p>
  For those who are interested in the gritty details of why definition checking wouldn't really be feasible
  with the Concepts TS without considerable breaking changes, a couple of very subtle examples
  are described in a discussion that took place in 2012 on the Boost Developers mailing list comparing
  pseudo-signatures and usage patterns.<sup><a href="p0240r0.html#References_Pseudo">[5]</a></sup> I encourage those
  who are interested in the topic to read it, as the details are out of scope of this paper.
  The conversation consisted of myself and several key people who were involved with Concepts of the past and of the present,
  notably including Dave Abrahams, Doug Gregor, Andrew Sutton, Larisse Voufo, and Jeremiah Willcock.
  Sadly, while the issues were understood and had been handled with C++0x concepts, and the
  reasons why it would be difficult to bring such checking to what would become the
  Concepts TS were known, little has changed and we are still at a point where
  there is no clear path forward toward proper definition checking in the Concepts TS.
  Definition checking is not simply something that can be added later. It is a feature that
  needs consideration throughout the design of a concepts language feature as it directly
  influences how constraints need to be represented.</p>

<a name="LibAndDesign"><h2>Should the design of Concepts be validated by applying them to the library?</h2></a>

<p>
  <i>Yes!</i>
</p>

<a name="Conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>

<p>
  In the very words of P0225R0, bringing Concepts into C++17 requires a
  "leap of faith". It is suggested that the risk of this leap is
  worthwhile in order to bring Concepts to programmers who are aching to
  use it. In actuality, no such leap is necessary. Programmers already
  can use Concepts in practice if they are willing to deal with a feature
  that is likely to evolve more quickly and be more willing to make
  breaking changes than C++ is. Let the Concepts TS continue evolving.
  This allows it to make large, breaking changes if and when such changes
  need to be made. For those who believe that the checking of constrained
  template definitions is important, the breakages likely would be vast,
  and we should not have to hesitate to make them. We should be free to do what
  makes the language the best that it can be with respect to the direct
  representation of the generic programming paradigm.
</p>
<p>
  Though I am not traditionally one who is conservative in these matters,
  in order to avoid the very real risk of painting ourselves into a corner
  regarding definition checking at a point in time where many people feel
  that it is important, we should hold off on Concepts. The concern is not
  FUD, but rather it is the reality of the complexities of definition checking
  in C++. The Concepts TS will get usage experience regardless, and in the upcoming years
  we should have both a constrained version of the standard library and a
  better answer as to whether or not this approach really is capable of providing
  a path towards the checking of constrained template definitions. At that point,
  we will be in a better position to safely bring Concepts into C++.
