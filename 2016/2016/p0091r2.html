<h1>Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 5)</h1> 
	<h2>Changes from <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0091r0.html">P0091R1</a></h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Added wording</li>
            <li>Discuss interaction with universal references</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> This paper proposes extending template argument deduction for functions
		to constructors of template classes and incorporates feedback from the EWG review of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0091r0.html">P0091R0</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/faisalv/clang/tree/clang-ctor-deduction">implementation experience</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, if we want to construct template classes, we need to specify the template arguments. 
	For example, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4498.html">N4498</a> on Variadic Lock Guards
	gives an example of acquiring a <tt>lock_guard</tt> on two mutexes inside an <tt>operator=</tt> to properly lock both the
	source and destination of the assignment. Expanding typedefs, the locks are acquired by the following statement
	(See the paper for details and rationale).
	<code>std::lock_guard&lt;std::shared_timed_mutex, std::shared_lock&lt;std::shared_timed_mutex&gt;&gt; lck(mut_, r1);</code>
	Having to specify the template arguments adds nothing but complexity! 
If constructors could deduce their template arguments "like we expect 
from other functions and methods," then the following vastly simpler and
 more intuitive code could have been used instead.
	<code>auto lock = std::lock_guard(mut_, r1);</code>

	</p>
	<p>The sections below first spell out the problem in more detail and 
then makes precise what "like we expect from other functions and 
methods" means in this context.</p>

	<h2><a name="Problem">The problem</a></h2>
	
	<p>To simplify the examples below, suppose the following definitions are in place.

<code>vector&lt;int&gt; vi1 = { 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };
vector&lt;int&gt; vi2;
std::mutex m;
unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; ul(m, std::defer_lock);
template&lt;class Func&gt;
class Foo() { 
public: 
    Foo(Func f) : func(f) {} 
    void operator()(int i) { 
      os &lt;&lt; "Calling with " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
      f(i); 
    } 
private: 
    Func func; 
    mutex mtx;
};</code>
</p><p>In the current standard, the following objects would be constructed as shown</p>
<code>pair&lt;int, double&gt; p(2, 4.5);
auto t = make_tuple(4, 3, 2.5);
copy_n(vi1, 3, back_inserter(vi2));
<span class="comment">// Virtually impossible to pass a lambda to a template class' constructor without declaring the lambda</span>
for_each(vi2.begin(), vi2.end(), Foo&lt;<span class="comment">???</span>&gt;([&amp;](int i) { <span class="comment">...</span>}));
lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lck(foo.mtx);
lock_guard&lt;std::mutex, std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt;&gt; lck2(foo.mtx, ul); <span class="comment">// Notation from N4470</span>
auto hasher = [](X const &amp; x) -&gt; size_t { <span class="comment">/* ... */</span> };
unordered_map&lt;X, int, decltype(hasher)&gt; ximap(10, hasher);
</code>

There are several problems with the above code:
<ul>

<li>Creating "make functions" like <tt>make_tuple</tt> is confusing,
artificial, extra boilerplate, and inconsistent with how non-template classes are constructed.</li>

<li>Since the standard library doesn't follow any consistent convention for
make functions, users have to scurry through documentation to find they need to
use <tt>make_tuple</tt> for <tt>tuple</tt>s
and <tt>back_inserter</tt> for <tt>back_insert_iterator</tt>s. Of course their own
template classes might not be as consistent or thoroughly-documented as the standard.</li>

<li>Specifying template arguments as in <tt>pair&lt;int, double&gt;(2, 4.5)</tt>
should be unnecessary since they can be inferred from the type of the arguments, as is
usual with template functions (this is the reason the standard provides make functions
for many template classes in the first place!).
</li>
	<li>A make function may do more than just deduce constructor template arguments. Unless
	a detailed study of the documentation is made (which usually only happens when debugging
	weird unexpected behavior...), subtle changes in semantics may occur. Committee members
	and other C++ experts are invited to see if they can tell which of the above make functions
	simply do the "obvious" deduction of template arguments.</li>
<li>If we don't have a make function, we may not be able to
create class objects without prior declarations of lambdas as indicated by the <tt><span class="comment">???</span></tt>
in the code above.</li>
<li>Using make functions with classes that aren't movable like <tt>std::lock_guard</tt> requires appealing to
	highly abstruse language features like copy elision for prvalues (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0135r0.html">P0135R0</a>),
	contributing to the perception that C++' conceptual model is beyond ordinary mortals.</li>
<li>The useful technique of replacing a large function with a class by 
organizing its code into methods to reduce cyclomatic complexity can't 
be used for template functions</li>
</ul>

If we allowed the compiler to deduce the template arguments for constructors of
template classes, we could replace the above with:

<code>pair p(2, 4.5);
tuple t(4, 3, 2.5);
copy_n(vi1, 3, back_insert_iterator(vi2));
for_each(vi.begin(), vi.end(), Foo([&amp;](int i) { <span class="comment">...</span>})); <span class="comment">// Now easy instead of virtually impossible</span>
auto lck = lock_guard(foo.mtx);
lock_guard lck2(foo.mtx, ul);
unordered_map&lt;X, int&gt; ximap(10, [](X const &amp; x) -&gt; size_t { <span class="comment">/* ... */</span> }); <span class="comment">// NOTE: template argument deduction deduces the non-explicitly specified template arguments</span>

</code>

We believe this is more consistent and simpler for both users and writers of
template classes, especially for user-defined classes that might
not have carefully designed and documented make functions like <tt>pair</tt>,
<tt>tuple</tt>, and <tt>back_insert_iterator</tt>.
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>We propose to allow a template name referring to a class template as a
simple-type-specifier or with partially supplied explicit template arguments in two contexts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simple declarations of variables (or variable templates) that are also definitions whose declarator is a <i>noptr-declarator</i>
 (i.e. not when declaring functions, template parameters, function 
parameters, non-static data members, pointers, references etc.), and</li>
    <code>
    template&lt;class ... Ts&gt; struct X { X(Ts...) };
    X x1{1}; <span class="comment">// OK X&lt;int&gt;</span>
    X x11; <span class="comment">// OK X&lt;&gt;</span>
    template&lt;class T&gt; X xv{(T*)0}; <span class="comment">// OK decltype(xv&lt;int&gt;) == X&lt;int*&gt;</span>
    extern X x2; <span class="comment">// NOT OK, needs to be a definition</span>
    X arr[10];   <span class="comment">// OK X&lt;&gt;</span>
    X x1{1}, x2{2}; <span class="comment">// OK, deduced to the same type X&lt;int&gt;</span>
    X&lt;int&gt; x3{1, 'a', "bc"}; <span class="comment">// OK X&lt;int,char,const char*&gt;</span>
    X *pointer = 0; <span class="comment">// NOT OK</span>
    X &amp;&amp;reference = X&lt;int&gt;{1};</span>
    X function(); <span class="comment">// NOT OK</span>
    </code>
  <li>Explicit type conversion (functional notation) ([expr.type.conv])</li>
</ul>

<p>We propose two techniques to support template argument deduction for class templates:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><a href="p0091r2.html#uec">Using implicitly synthesized deduction guides (from existing constructors)</a></li>
	   <li><a href="p0091r2.html#udg">Using explicitly specified deduction guides</a></li>
    </ul>
	These techniques can work well together as will be explained below. They
	can also be adopted separately. Both forms received consensus straw polls
        from EWG (although note that the authors did not vote unanimously in support of implicit guides).<p></p>

    
    <h3><a name="uec">Implicitly synthesized Deduction Guides (from existing constructors)</a></h3><a name="uec">
<p>
In the case of a function-notation type conversion (e.g., "<tt>tuple(1, 2.0, false)</tt>") or a direct parenthesized or braced initialization,
the initialization is resolved as follows.
First, constructors and constructor templates declared in the named template
are enumerated.  Let Ci be such a constructor or constructor template;
together they form an overload set.  A parallel overload set (i.e. the implicitly synthesized deduction guides) <i>F</i> of function templates is then created as follows:</p>

<p>For each Ci a function template is constructed with template parameters that
include both those of the named class template and if Ci is a constructor
template, those of that template (default arguments are included too) --
the function parameters are the constructor parameters, and the return type
is the template-name followed by the template-parameters of the class template enclosed in &lt;&gt;</p>

Deduction and overload resolution is then performed for an invented call
to <i>F</i> with the parenthesized or braced expressions used as arguments.
If that call doesn't yield a "best viable function", the program is ill-formed.
Otherwise, the return type of the selected <i>F</i> template specialization becomes the deduced class template specialization.
<p></p>
Let's look at an example:
<code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct UniquePtr {
    UniquePtr(T* t);
    <span class="comment">...</span>
};

UniquePtr dp{new auto(2.0)};
</code>
<p>
In the above example, <tt>UniquePtr</tt> is missing template arguments in the 
declaration of 'dp' so they have to be deduced. To deduce the 
initialized type, the compiler then creates an overload set as follows:
</p>
        
<code>
    template&lt;typename T&gt; 
        UniquePtr&lt;T&gt; <i>F</i>(UniquePtr&lt;T&gt; const&amp;);
    template&lt;typename T&gt; 
        UniquePtr&lt;T&gt; <i>F</i>(UniquePtr&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp;);
    template&lt;typename T&gt; 
        UniquePtr&lt;T&gt; <i>F</i>(T *p);
    
</code>
<p>
Then the compiler performs overload resolution for a call "<tt><i>F</i>(2.0)</tt>"
 
which in this case finds a unique best candidate in the last synthesized
 function and after final substitution, deduces the class template 
specialization as <tt>UniquePtr&lt;double&gt;</tt>
</p>     
<p>
Let's look at a more involved example:
<code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct S {
  template&lt;typename U&gt; struct N {
    N(T);
    N(T, U);
    template&lt;typename V&gt; N(V, U);
  };
};

S&lt;int&gt;::N x{2.0, 1};
</code>

In this example, "<tt>S&lt;int&gt;::N</tt>" in the declaration of <tt>x</tt>
is missing template arguments, so the approach above kicks in.
Template arguments can only be left out this way from the "type" of the
declaration, but not from any name qualifiers used in naming the template;
i.e., we couldn't replace "<tt>S&lt;int&gt;::N</tt>" by just "<tt>S::N</tt>"
using some sort of additional level of deduction.
To deduce the initialized type, the compiler now creates an overload set as
follows:

<code>
    template&lt;typename U&gt; 
        S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; <i>F</i>(S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; const&amp;);
    template&lt;typename U&gt; 
        S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; <i>F</i>(S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; &amp;&amp;);
    template&lt;typename U&gt; 
        S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; <i>F</i>(int);
    template&lt;typename U&gt;
        S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; <i>F</i>(int, U);
    template&lt;typename U, typename V&gt; 
        S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;U&gt; <i>F</i>(V, U);
</code>

(The first two candidates correspond to the implicitly-declared copy and move
contructors. Note that template parameter <tt>T</tt> is already known to
be <tt>int</tt> and is not a template parameter in the synthesized overload
set.)

Then the compiler performs overload resolution for a call "<tt><i>F</i>(2.0, 1)</tt>" 
which in this case finds a unique best candidate in the last synthesized function
with <tt>U = int</tt> and <tt>V = double</tt> and deduced type of <tt>S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;int&gt;</tt>.  The initialization
is therefore treated as "<tt>S&lt;int&gt;::N&lt;int&gt; x{2.0, 1};</tt>"
</p>



<p>
Note that after the deduction process described above the initialization may
still end up being ill-formed.  For example, a selected constructor might be
inaccessible or deleted, or the selected template instance might have been
specialized or partially specialized in such a way that the candidate
constructors will not match the initializer.
</p>

The case of a <i>simple-declaration</i> with copy-initialization syntax is treated
similarly to the approach described above, except that explicit constructors
and constructor templates are ignored, and the initializer expression is
used as the single call argument during the deduction process.

<h3><a name="udg">Explicitly specified Deduction Guides</a></h3><a name="udg">
	<p>While the above procedure generates many useful deducible constructors,
		some constructors that we would like to be deducible are not. For example, 
		one could imaging a function <tt>make_vector</tt>
    defined as follows:</p>
	<code>template&lt;typename Iter&gt;
vector&lt;Iter::value_type&gt; make_vec(Iter b, Iter e) {
  return vector&lt;Iter::value_type&gt;(b, e);
}
    </code>
<p>Although there is no constructor in <tt>vector</tt> from which we can deduce the type
    of the vector from two iterators, one would like to be able to deduce the type of
	the vector from the value type of the two iterators.
		For example, some implementations of the STL define their <tt>value_type</tt>
<tt>typedef</tt> as follows
<code>template&lt;typename T, typename Alloc=std::allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt;
struct vector {
  struct iterator {
    typedef T value_type;
    <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
  };
  typedef iterator::value_type value_type;
  <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
};
</code>
The detour through <tt>vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator</tt> keeps us from
deducing that <tt>T</tt> is <tt>char</tt> in a constructor call like <tt>vector(5, 'c')</tt>.
We would certainly like constructors like that to work.</p>

<p>We suggest a notation to allow explicit specification of a deduction 
guide in the same semantic scope as the class template using the 
following syntax:
	<code>template&lt;typename T, typename Alloc = std::allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt; struct vector {
  <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
};
template&lt;typename Iter&gt; vector(Iter b, Iter e) -&gt; vector&lt;typename iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::value_type&gt;
</code>
 </p><p>In effect, this allows users to leverage all the deduction rules
 that are specifiable by any function with a standard first-class name 
and no boilerplate code in the body. It also allows us
	to suppress a standard deduction from the above process via "<tt>= delete;"</tt></p>  

    <p>Note that a deduction guide is not a function and shall not have a
 body. It participates in deduction of class template arguments in a 
similar way to the synthesized deduction guides.</p>
    <p>Additionally, it is worthwhile to note the following:</p>
    <ul><li>Deduction guides must name a class template and must be 
introduced within the same semantic scope of the class template, but 
they do not becomes members of that scope (i.e if that scope is a class)
 </li></ul>
<h4>Alternate notation</h4>
As an alternative to the above notation for explicit deduction guides, one could consider a &ldquo;declaration
	notation&rdquo;. E.g., 
<code>template&lt;typename Iter&gt; vector&lt;typename iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::value_type&gt; vector(Iter b, Iter e); 
template&lt;typename Iter&gt; auto vector(Iter b, Iter e) -&gt; vector&lt;typename iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::value_type&gt;; 
</code>
	<p>The point is that this uses a familiar notation to declare what the canonical &ldquo;make function&rdquo;
	would look like as a function declaration. As the above lines are not legal C++14 (cf. &sect;14p5),
	this would not reinterpret existing function declarations, and the compiler or linker would not need to check
	for a function definition. This could potentially be easier for programmers to learn as they do not need to
	learn a new grammatical construct, and there is indeed an &ldquo;function&rdquo; instantiated to match the
	declaration. The downside of the &ldquo;declaration notation&rdquo; is of course the quotes around &ldquo;function&rdquo;, as
	this is not actually a function declaration.</p>
	<p>The prototype uses &ldquo;declaration notation&rdquo;, but we believe there are no technical parsing obstacles
	to either (always a relief when defining new C++ features!) and that it is a matter of the preference of the committee.</p> 
<h3>A note on injected class names</h3>
<p>The focus on this paper is on simplifying the interface of a
	class for its clients. Within a class, one may need to explicitly specify the arguments as 
	before due to the injected class name:</p>
<code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct X {
  template&lt;typename Iter&gt;
  X(Iter b, Iter e) { <span class="comment">/* ... */</span> }
	
  template&lt;typename Iter&gt;
  auto foo(Iter b, Iter e) { 
     return X(b, e); <span class="comment">// X&lt;U&gt; to avoid breaking change</span>
  }
	
  template&lt;typename Iter&gt;
  auto bar(Iter b, Iter e) { 
     return X&lt;Iter::value_type&gt;(b, e); <span class="comment">// Must specify what we want</span>
  }
};
</code>
<h3><a name="CodeCompatibility">Code compatibility</a></h3><a name="CodeCompatibility">
While we cannot say whether it is a problem in practice, we should point out a 
scenario where auto-deduction can break compatibility. 
	
<p>Suppose I produce a library and I'm under license to preserve source 
compatibility across all 1.x upgrades, and I have this class template in
 version 1.0:</p>

<code>template<typename t=""> struct X {
  X(T);
};</typename></code>

	<p>... and in version 1.1 I rewrite it as this:</p>

<code>template<typename t=""> struct X {
  struct iterator { typedef T type; };
  X(typename iterator::type);
};</typename></code>

<p>If one of my users upgrades to C++17, with this change in the 
language, I am no longer complying with the terms of my licensing. 
Likewise, if this language change happens between me releasing 1.0 and 
1.1, I can no longer release version 1.1 because it might break some of 
my existing customers.</p>

<p>The point is: current code does not express any intent about whether 
class template parameters are deducible, based on whether they use the 
version 1.0 code or the version 1.1 code. But this change makes that 
implicit property into part of the de facto interface of the code.</p>
<h3><a name="ProsConsImplicit">Pros and cons of implicit deduction guides</a></h3>
<p>In light of the above, we think it is worth calling out the benefits and
	costs of providing implicit deduction guides versus requiring explicit
	deduction guides everywhere</p>

<p>Basically, having to manually specify boilerplate for what is obviously expected has an 
	insidious cost as any (honest) Java programmer can tell you. There are natural
	implementations of all of the examples in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/Problem">The Problem</a> section
	above where only implicit deduction guides are necessary. (Alternate implementations of
	those classes may require explicit guides but do not create unnatural deductions). As many classes have
	dozens of constructors, not only is creating myriad explicit deduction guides tedious and
	error-prone but will (predictably) drift out of sync with the actual constructors as the class 
	evolves. While not suitable for all purposes, this is a much-requested feature to
	simplify routine programming (cf. range-based <tt>for</tt>) and current practice or
	explicit deduction guides remain available (see next paragraph for exceptions) 
	if the implicit deduction is not sufficient, mitigating downside.</p>
	<p>So what is the cost of implicit deduction guides? The <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/CodeCompatibility">Code compatibility</a>
	section above shows that equivalent code in C++14 may no longer be equivalent in C++17 (Note that
	this example does not change the behavior of C++14 code when compiled with a C++17 compiler). This particular
	incompatibility can be rectified by adding explicit deduction guides as needed.</p>
	<p>Another cost of implicit deduction guides is that they may trigger instantiations that
	cause hard errors. For example, consider the following class</p>
	<code>template&lt;class T&gt; struct X {
     using ty = T::type;
     static auto foo() { return typename T::type{} };
     X(ty); #1
     X(decltype(foo())); #2
     X(T);
  };
		
  template&lt;class T&gt;
  struct X&lt;T*&gt; { 
    X(...);
  };
	</code>
	<p>For such a class, the prototype implementation allows</p>
<code>X x{(int *)0};</code>
<p>but normal instantiation rules suggest a hard error. We plan to discuss implications with
the committee. Note that
the current
<code>X&lt;int *&gt; x{0}</code></p>
remains legal.
	<h3>Universal reference interactions</h3>
By deducing the template arguments, sometimes and rvalue reference can be reinterpreted as a universal
	reference as the following example due to Sebastian Gesemann shows.
<code>template&lt;class T&gt;
    struct Wrapper
    {
        T value;
        Wrapper(T const&amp; x): value(x) {}
        Wrapper(T &amp;&amp; y): value(std::move(x)) {}
    };

    int main()
    {
        std::string foo = "Hello";
        auto w = Wrapper(foo);           // Error
    }
</code>
<p>In the implicit deduction guide for the second constructor, <tt>T &amp;&amp;</tt> is
	now interpreted as a universal reference rather than an rvalue reference, resulting in
	a failure to find a valid match. This does not seem to result in a dangerous deduction
	but rather a failure to compile, but Core should consider this case.

	will need to be written to explain the intent. </p>
	<code>template&lt;typename T&gt; Wrapper(T &amp;&amp;y) -&gt; Wrapper&lt;remover_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt;;</code>
	<p>Of course,  traditional constructor

<h2>Wording</h2>
<p>Insert a paragraph after &sect;3.4p3 [basic.lookup]: </p>
	<blockquote><span class="ins">If the lookup finds the name of a template class and is not the injected-class-name,
		then it also finds all sythesized functions associated with deduction guides for that template class (14.9).</span></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><em>declaration:

Also, change the note at the bottom of &sect;7p1 [dcl.dcl] as follows
	<blockquote>[<em>Note: asm-definitions</em> are described in 7.4, and <em>linkage-specifications</em> are
	described in 7.5. <em>Function-definitions</em> are described in 8.4 and 
	<em>template-declaration</em>s <span class="ins">and <em>deduction-guide</em>s</span> are described in Clause 14.</blockquote>

<p>At the end of clause 14 [Template], add a new section</p>	
	<blockquote><h3><span class="ins">14.9 Deduction guides</span></h3>
		<p><span class="ins">Deduction guides synthesize functions associated with constructors of class templates
			to participate in template argument deduction(14.8.2) similarly to function templates.
			Deduction guides may be either <em>implicit</em> or <em>explicit</em>.</span></p> 
		<p><span class="ins">The compiler generates an
			implicit deduction guide for every constructor in a primary class template. The synthesized function
			associated with a constructor in the primary class template has the template parameters of the
			class primary template followed by any template parameters from the constructor. The function parameters for the synthesized function are the same as for the constructor and
			the return type is that of the class template, and the effect of the function is to return the object
			constructed by calling that constructor.</span></p>
			
		[<span class="ins"><em>Example:</em></span>
	<blockquote><pre><span class="ins">template&lt;class T&gt; class X { X(T t) { <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>}
	
void f() { 
  auto x = X(7); <span class="comment">// <tt>T</tt> is deduced to <tt>int</tt></span>
}</pre></blockquote>[<span class="ins"><em>&mdash; end example</em>]</span>
<p><span class="ins">Explicit deduction guides declare constructors that participate in template argument deduction.

	deduction guide, and the effect of the deduction guide is to construct an object of the return type by forwarding its function
