<h2><a name="1.0">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The C++11 standard introduced <tt>allocator_traits</tt> as a way to easily support
a variety of allocator models, especially those where allocators hold some kind of
state that might affect allocator, such as a pointer to a memory resource,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3916">N3916</a>.
One of the problems that had to be tackled was the effect of calling <tt>swap</tt>
on containers (or other allocator-aware types) that have allocators that do not
compare equal.  The committee at the time took the conservative option of simply
making this undefined behavior, and a couple of issues have since been filed
regarding some of the problems this causes:
<a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2152">LWG #2152</a>,
<a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2153">LWG #2153</a>.
The last time the Library Working Group looked at these issues, it called for a
paper to better describe the issues and propose a solution (with wording!)  This
is that paper.
</p>

<h2><a name="2.0">The Basic Problem</a></h2>
<p>
When support for stateful allocators was added to C++11, it became important to
answer the question of what should happen when two containers with allocators
that cannot allocate/deallocate memory on behalf of the other are <tt>swap</tt>ped.
The conservative position adopted at the time was to simply declare such calls
out of contract, and make them undefined behavior.  This gave us the maximum
freedom to revise our position later, if necessary.  It also matched the contract
Bloomberg documented for their library, which was one of the code bases known to
make widespread use of stateful allocators.
</p>

<p>
The problem with giving the free-function swap a <i>narrow</i> contract is that
it does not satisfy the contract of the generic <tt>swap</tt> function in the
same namespace.  This greatly harms the ability to use <tt>std::swap</tt> in
generic code, as the calling template must now be aware if the type it is
instantiated for is a standard library container, and if so, whether its
allocators compare equal.  Conversely, this is not a problem for the <tt>swap</tt>
member function, as the caller either knows exactly which container they are
dealing with, or should document the container concept they are dealing with
if it differs in some way from the standard.  In some sense, the generic free
function is more fundamental than the member function.
</p>

<p>
There has been some concern raised that the standard library cannot make arbitrary
constraints on <tt>swap</tt> function found via ADL, so this exercise is vain.
That is not entirely true, as if we assume the container requirements apply to user
code, then we are already changing their <tt>swap</tt> contract by introducing
undefined behavior.  However, in practice, the current Container Requirements tables
do not document Concepts, but are rather a form of common documentation to avoid
redundant wording through each of the container sub-clauses.  In this context, the
standard library has broken its own <tt>swap</tt> function by adding an overload
in its own namespace that, if not present, would allow the container to &quot;do
the right thing&quot;, and with move-semantics enabled for each container, do so
efficiently with the correct exception-safety guarnatees.  The optimization offered
by the overload, in a modern compiler, is tiny (but still worth taking, especially
for containers with additional predicates).
</p>

<p>
The breakage of <tt>swap</tt> has more subtle implications too.  The author of
generic code could, by defining their own <tt>is_standard_container</tt> trait,
rewrite their algorithm to allow for exchanging states of containers with
unequal allocators.  In fact, this is necessary for any generic algorithm that
expects to work with containers unless the contract explicitly calls out this
problem.  The standard library offers no support for users trying to help
their users in this manner.  However, the further subtlety is that
<tt>is_standard_container</tt> is not sufficient, as <tt>swap</tt> for
<tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt> is similarly undefined, and would need to be
detected and supported separately.  This problem further eats into any other
type that wraps a standard container and can support stateful allocators.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">Feedback from field experience</a></h3>
<p>
Bloomberg have over a decade of experience with a stateful allocator model in
their standard library.  When this was first introduced, the undefined behavior
described by the current standard was added to all of our <tt>swap</tt>
contracts, but the (undocumented) implementation performs the double-copy/swap
described in this paper.  This allowed existing code, written without stateful
allocators in mind, to continue to function while the new contract was slowly
adopted.  A decade on, we still get large resistance any time we try to enable
assertions on these narrow contracts, as perfectly sensible use-cases exist
(frequently, not always, in generic code) for continuing to support this
behavior.  Given the choice between linear and potentially-throwing <tt>swap</tt>
vs. undefined behavior, our users have been very clear which they prefer -
as long as the constant-time, non-throwing behavior remains when the allocators
do compare equal.
</p>

<h2><a name="3.0">Proposed Solution</a></h2>
<p>
The simplest implementation of the <tt>swap</tt> overload (for a given
<i><tt>CONTAINER_TYPE</tt></i>) should be efficient and correct, without
preconditions:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void swap(CONTAINER_TYPE &amp; left, CONTAINER_TYPE &amp; right) {
   std::swap&lt;TYPE&gt;(left, right);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, the optimal algorithm for swapping containers (or any other
allocator-aware type) might be more like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void swap(CONTAINER_TYPE &amp; left, CONTAINER_TYPE &amp; right) {
   if (<i>allocators are compatible</i>) {
      left.swap(right);
   }
   else if (<i>allocator propagation traits are sane</i>) {
      std::swap&lt;TYPE&gt;(left, right);
   }
   else {
      CONTAINER_TYPE tempLeft {std::move(right), left.get_allocator() };
      CONTAINER_TYPE tempRight{std::move(left ), right.get_allocator()};
      swap(left,  tempLeft );
      swap(right, tempRight);
   }
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We assume that containers provide a <tt>swap</tt> member function, which has
the precondition that allocators must compare equal (otherwise behavior is
undefined, as today).  The check that <i>allocators are compatible</i> is that
they propagate on swap (a compile-time check), or if they are always equal (a
compile-time check added as part of C++17), or if they compare equal at
run-time.  The check that <i>allocator propagation traits are sane</i> is a
compile-time test which really means that they are the same; either both derive
from <tt>true_type</tt>, or both derive from <tt>false_type</tt>.  See P0177r0
for more details on this problem, and a proposed resolution that would simplify
what we need to consider in this paper (without changing the conclusion).
</p>

<p>
The final branch is clearly expensive, making two copies of each container, but
has the benefit of the strong exception safety guarantee.  This is a nice
bonus, although not something guaranteed by <tt>std::swap</tt>, and something
we prefer to not pay for if we do not need it.  However, if we consider the
middle branch, what are we really saving, when the allocators do not compare
equal?  Here is a typical implementation of <tt>std::swap</tt>, with comments
of anticipated costs when allocators are different.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;typename TYPE&gt;
void swap(TYPE &amp; left, TYPE &amp; right) {
   TYPE temp{std::move(right)};  <i>// Efficient move construction</i>
   right = std::move(left);      <i>// move-assign-with-different-allocator, copy-swap implementation</i>
   left  = std::move(temp);      <i>// move-assign-with-different-allocator, copy-swap implementation</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Observant readers will want to consider the case that allocators propagate on
move-assignment, so that the two assignments in this implementation would be
efficient.  However, to get to this middle option, we have already considered
the case that allocators are <i>compatible</i>, which includes the case that
they propagate.  Hence, we do not get here if allocators propagate for both
move-assignment and swap, nor do we get here if they differ due to the sanity
check.  Likewise, if the container allocators compared equal, we would also
have taken the first branch, so we end up in the middle branch only in the case
that the allocators are different, and never propagate.  In such cases, the
logic of the third and final branch is actually a slight unrolling of what
would otherwise take place, while re-ordering work so that the strong exception
safety guarantee holds (for free) so the proposed solution is to drop that
middle branch.
</p>

<p>
One final note on exception-safety guarantees are that we do not quite get the
strong guarantee in all cases.  Associative and unordered associative containers
store function objects that are permitted to have throwing swap and assignment
operators.  The proposed resolution is no worse in such cases, but offers only
the basic exception-safety guarantee.  The LEWG may separately want to consider
whether such support is still warranted as a separate issue, paying particular
attention to
<a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2189">LWG #2189</a>.
</p>

<p>
How does this proposal compare to the existing contract?  If the allocator
propagate on swap, or always compare equal (such as <tt>std::allocator</tt>)
then this has exactly the same effect, only we define the free-function
<tt>swap</tt> in terms of the member-function, rather than the other way
around.  If the allocator is stateful, and compares equal at runtime, we have
mandated one extra run-time branch to check that allocators compare equal
before yielding either the exact same algorithm as before.  However, if the
allocators do not compare equal, we turn undefined (library) behavior into
well-defined behavior.  Given the presence of the runtime-check is not
observable behavior, this implementation would be perfectly conforming for
C++11, or even C++98.  Note that this does not mean that existing
implementations would not have to change, merely that portable code could not
be relying on any of the differences that are exposed.
</p>

<p>
Also, see paper
<a href="p0177r0.html">P0177R0</a>
for a possible direction to simplify further, by requiring all allocators
to have <i>sane</i> propagation traits.

<p>
Note that only sequence containers lack <tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>Pred</tt>, or
<tt>Hash</tt> types, so only sequence containers have a requirement to not
throw.  This constrains only the member function, which retain the no-throw
guarantee on <tt>swap</tt> for all sequence containers in this paper - as
member-<tt>swap</tt> with unequal non-propagating allocators remains undefined
behavior.
