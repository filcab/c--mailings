February 2017 WG21 Meeting
 
The February 2017 WG21 meeting is sponsored by Plum Hall and the
Standard C++ Foundation.  The meeting will take place at the Royal
Kona Resort, in Kailua-Kona Hawaii, Monday Feb 27 to Saturday Mar 04.
The hotel's web site is here:
 
   <a href="http://www.royalkona.com ">http://www.royalkona.com</a> 
 
(This was the location of the October 2015 meeting, as well as others
before that.)  The hotel is located in downtown Kailua-Kona, which has
remained the most-requested location for Big Island meetings.  In
addition to the hotel restaurant, there are many other eating places
within walking distance.  Because of the downtown location, a rental
car is unnecessary; however, it can be useful for island excursions.
 
The Keahole Airport (Kailua-Kona, airport code KOA) is about 8 miles
north from downtown; a shared taxi is the best airport transport.
Don't allow your travel agent to book you inadvertently to Hilo
Airport (ITO), unless you have intentionally planned the scenic
three-hour drive into your itinerary.  If your travel agent books you
to Honolulu, you will still need another flight to get to Kona (KOA).
 
Reservations for the hotel room can be made online at this web page:

   Then enter Groupcode  plumhall
   Then be sure that your arrival and departure dates are correct!
