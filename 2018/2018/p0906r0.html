<h1>P0906R0: Improvement suggestions for the Modules TS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

During CWG review of the Modules TS, I stumbled upon some corner cases
that, in my view, result in surprising and inconsistent outcomes. This
paper suggests changes to the Modules TS to reduce the surprises. In
the examples below, I show the normative outcome according to the
current Modules TS.

<h2>1 Different access paths to a type</h2>

For an exported entity, only the properties introduced or implicitly
redeclared in exported declarations are reachable from the outside.
<p>
In contrast, properties of a non-exported entity are reachable from
the outside according to the "attendant entities" rules in 10.7.6.  A
special error condition in paragraph 3 ensures a consistent view from
the outside.  Example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
export module M;
struct S;
export S f();     // #1; cannot call this function (incomplete return type)
struct S { };
export S g();     // error: attendant class type S has different properties vs. #1 (see 10.7.6p3)
</pre>
</blockquote>

From the outside (i.e. from a module or main program importing M),
decltype(f()) would access an incomplete S and decltype(g()) would
access the complete S, which would be inconsistent.  The resolution in
the Modules TS is to make a module giving rise to this situation
ill-formed.
<p>

However, there are other situations where different access paths are
resolved by essentially simply exporting the complete type.  Example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
export module M;
struct C { };
struct S {
  struct B { };
  using C = ::C;
};
export S f();     // #1; S::B and ::C are not attendant entities
export C g();     // #2; ::C is an attendant entity

// elsewhere
import M;
int x = sizeof(decltype(f())::B);  // error: incomplete class type B
int y = sizeof(decltype(f())::C);  // ok: C is complete
</pre>
</blockquote>

By design, nested types are not attendant entitites and thus the
completeness of <code>S::B</code> or <code>S::C</code> is not
reachable from the outside given only #1.  However, the completeness
can be added to the reachable properties by a later, unrelated
declaration such as #2.  In this case, the access path through #1 will
see the complete type <code>S::C</code>.
<p>
It seems strange to treat the two examples differently.  For the first
example, instead of making the program ill-formed, an alternative
resolution that preserves the consistency design goal is to simply
consider <code>S</code> a complete type from the outside. The uniform
rule would be "the properties of an entity reachable from the outside
are the union of those made available through contributing
declarations".  This rule also addresses exported entities, where (of
course) only <em>export-declaration</em>s contribute.

<p>
  It is recommended to treat this as a Defect Report against the Modules TS.

<h2>2 Definitions of inline functions</h2>

Module interface units serve two purposes: One, they offer a set of
declarations visible to all module implementation units. These are all
the declarations in the purview of the module interface unit.  Two,
they offer a set of declarations (entities, properties) visible to the
outside. These are the exported declarations plus their attendant
entities. For a given entity such as a class type or a function, it is
possible to export a subset of the properties by forward-declaring
with <code>export</code> and later redeclaring (or defining)
without <code>export</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
export module M;

export int f(int);
int f(int = 5);

export struct S;
struct S { int x; };

export constexpr int g(int);
constexpr int g(int x) { return x+1; }

// elsewhere
import M;
int x = f();        // error: default argument not visible
S y;                // error: S is not complete
constexpr int z = g(42);   // ok
</pre>
</blockquote>

This allows programmer control of the properties visible from the outside.
<p>
However, this does not apply to definitions of inline functions.  If
an inline function is exported, its definition must always appear in
the module interface unit (10.1.2 [dcl.fct.spec]) and the definition
itself is implicitly exported (10.7.6p1 [dcl.module.reach]). (It is
understood that a definition of an inline function must be reachable
whenever it is called.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
export module M;
export class S {
public:
  // public, exported interface
protected:
  void f();     // helper function, exported "by accident"
};
export class D : public S {
public:
  void g();
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

Assume that <code>S::f</code> should get an inline definition, but will
only be called from a single module implementation unit (the one
implementing <code>D::g</code>).  It seems the only currently valid
place where to put the inline definition is the module interface unit,
also implicitly making that inline definition exported. However, to
implement the use-case, it would be sufficient (and expose fewer
things) to put the inline definition into the module implementation unit
for <code>D::g</code>.
<p>
Further, a module importing M could inspect <code>S::f</code> for its
type (return type, parameter types), and such inspection would not
need the definition of <code>S::f</code>.
<p>
The reasoning that supports selectively exporting default function
arguments or class type definitions should also apply here: Give the
programmer control of what is and is not exported.
<p>
Since constexpr functions are implicitly inline, a change here does
also apply to constexpr functions.
<p>
It is recommended to treat this as a Defect Report against the Modules TS.

<h2>3 Allow vacuous exports</h2>

The keyword <code>export</code> can be used to export a single
declaration, or a brace-enclosed sequence of declarations. However,
the syntactic treatment is different from linkage specifications
[dcl.link], a similar context where such a construction is allowed.

<blockquote>
<pre>
extern "C++" {
  int f();
  static_assert(1 == 1, "blah");   // ok
  static int g();                  // ok; linkage specification does not apply
}

export {
  int f();
  static_assert(1 == 1, "blah");   // error: does not declare a name
  static int g();                  // error: cannot export function declared static
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

A linkage specification is ignored for all declarations to which it
does not apply.  In contrast, attempting to export a declaration that
cannot be exported (e.g. a <code>static_assert</code>) makes the
program ill-formed.
<p>
Assuming that both constructs are intended to change a given property
of a possibly large set of pre-existing declarations with minimal
syntax, I suggest to allow such vacuous exports.  Pre-existing sets of
declarations that are converted to modules might reasonably
contain <code>static_assert</code>s or unnamed namespaces in the
middle of to-be-exported declarations. Rearranging the code might be
too much of a burden.
<p>  
It is recommended to treat this as a Defect Report against the Modules TS.

<h2>4 Exclude private members from attendant entities</h2>

The current rules in 10.7.6 [dcl.module.reach] paragraph 2 do not
differentiate between public, protected, and private members when
defining the set of attendant entities, although properties of private
members cannot be discovered from outside the defining module.  Example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
  export module M;
  struct S { };
  class C {
  public:
    void f();
  private:
    S g();   // helper function
  };
  export C h();   // S is among the attendant entities
</pre>
</blockquote>

There is no way to name <code>C::g()</code> from outside the module
defining <code>C</code>, thus there is no way to name the return type
of <code>C::g()</code>.  Consistent with the approach to clearly
delineate what is visible from the outside, I suggest to remove
consideration of private members for attendant entities.
<p>  
It is recommended to treat this as a Defect Report against the Modules TS.

<h2>Wording changes for #1, #2, and #4</h2>

Change in 10.7.6 [dcl.module.reach] paragraph 3:

<blockquote>
If X is an attendant entity of two exported declarations designating
two distinct entities, its reachable semantic properties <del>shall be
the same at the points where the declarations occur</del> <ins>are the
union of those introduced where the declarations occur</ins>.
 [ Example:
<pre>
          export module M;
          struct S;
          export S f();    // <del>#1</del>
          struct S { };
          export S g();    // <del>error: class type S has different properties from #1</del> <ins>ok</ins>

	  <ins>// translation unit 2
	  import M;
	  decltype(f()) x;  // ok, entity S is a complete type</ins>  
</pre>
-- end example ]
</blockquote>

Editorial note: Maybe this rule can be folded into paragraph 2.
<p>

Drop the change to 10.1.2 [dcl.fct.spec]:

<blockquote>
<del>An exported inline function shall be defined in the same translation
unit containing its export declaration. [ Note: There is no
restriction on the linkage (or absence thereof) of entities that the
function body of an exported inline function can reference. A
constexpr function (10.1.5) is implicitly inline. -- end note ]</del>
</blockquote>

Remove in 10.7.6 [dcl.module.reach] paragraph 1 bullet 1:

<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>...  <del>Furthermore, if D denotes an inline function, the
property that the inline function has a definition (10.1.2) is a
reachable semantic property, even if that definition is not
      exported.</del> Otherwise,</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

Change in 10.7.6 [dcl.module.reach] paragraph 2, second list, bullet 3:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>...</li>
<li>If T is a class type owned by M, the set of attendant entities
includes T itself, the union of the sets of the attendant entities
determined by its direct <ins>public or protected</ins> base classes
owned by M, the sets of the attendant entities of its data members,
static data member templates, member functions, member function
templates, the function parameters of its constructors and constructor
templates<ins>, as far as these members are public or
protected</ins>. Furthermore, if T is a class template specialization,
the set of attendant entities also includes: the class template if it
is owned by M , the union of the sets of attendant entities determined
by the type template-arguments, the sets of the attendant entities of
the templates used as template template-arguments, the sets of the
attendant entities determined by the types of the non-type
template-arguments. </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
