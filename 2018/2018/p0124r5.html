<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Linux-kernel memory model is currently defined very informally in the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt">memory-barriers.txt</a> and
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/atomic_ops.txt">atomic_ops.txt</a>
files in the source tree.
Although these two files appear to have been reasonably effective at helping
kernel hackers understand what is and is not permitted, they are not
necessarily sufficient for deriving the corresponding formal model.
This document is a first attempt to bridge this gap.
Up-to-date versions of the Linux-kernel memory model may be found in the
Linux kernel at
<tt>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git</tt>
in the directory <tt>tools/memory-model</tt>,
with installation instructions referenced in the <tt>README</tt> file.
An earlier version of this model is available from a git archive
(<tt>https://github.com/aparri/memory-model</tt>),
with installation instructions provided 
<a href="http://wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2017:linux-kernel_memory_model_workshop">here</a>.
This model is a successor to the one described in the two-part LWN series
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718628/">here</a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/720550/">here</a>,
which is in turn an elaboration of the model described
<a href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/scalability/paper/LinuxMM.2017.01.19a.LCA.pdf">here</a>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULFytshTvIY">video</a>,
<a href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/scalability/paper/LinuxMM.2017.01.19a-ext.LCA.pdf">extended presentation</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus">litmus-test repository</a>).
</p>

<p>
This paper is for informational purposes.
The hope is that this document will help the C and C++ standard committees
understand the existing practice and the constraints from the Linux kernel,
and also that it will help the Linux community evaluate which portions of
the C11 and C++11 memory models might be useful in the Linux kernel.
</p>

<p>
All that said, the Linux kernel does not mark declarations of variables
and structure fields that are to be manipulated atomically.
This means that the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html"><tt>__atomic</tt></a>
built-ins, which in gcc generate the same code as their C11-atomic counterparts
are easier to apply to the Linux kernel than are the C11 atomics.

<h2><a name="Variable Access">Variable Access</a></h2>

<p>
Loads from and stores to shared (but non-atomic) variables should be
protected with the
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, and the now-obsolete
<tt><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/508991/">ACCESS_ONCE()</a></tt>
macros, for example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
r1 = READ_ONCE(x);
WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
r2 = ACCESS_ONCE(x); /* Obsolete. */
ACCESS_ONCE(y) = 1;  /* Obsolete. */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
A <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, and
the now-obsolete <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> accesses may be modeled as a
<tt>volatile</tt> <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> access.
However, please note that these macros are defined to work properly
only for properly aligned machine-word-sized variables.
Applying <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> to a large array or structure
is unlikely to do anything useful, and use of <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>
and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> in this situation can result in load-tearing
and store-tearing, respectively.
Nevertheless, this is their definition.
Linux-kernel developer would most certainly not be thankful to the
compiler for adding locks to <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>,
or <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> when applied to oversized objects.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <tt>volatile</tt> is absolutely required:
Non-<tt>volatile</tt> <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> is
not sufficient.
To see this, consider that <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> can be used to prevent
concurrently modified accesses from being hoisted out of a loop or out
of unrolled instances of a loop.
For example, given this loop:
</p>

<pre>
	while (tmp = atomic_load_explicit(a, memory_order_relaxed))
		do_something_with(tmp);
</pre>

<p>
The compiler would be permitted to unroll it as follows:
</p>

<pre>
	while (tmp = atomic_load_explicit(a, memory_order_relaxed))
		do_something_with(tmp);
		do_something_with(tmp);
		do_something_with(tmp);
		do_something_with(tmp);
	}
</pre>

<p>
This would be unacceptable for real-time applications, which need the
value to be reloaded from <tt>a</tt> on each iteration, unrolled
or not.
The <tt>volatile</tt> qualifier prevents this transformation.
For example, consider the following loop:
</p>

<pre>
	while (tmp = READ_ONCE(a))
		do_something_with(tmp);
</pre>

<p>
This loop could still be unrolled, but the read would also need to be
unrolled, for example, like this:
</p>

<pre>
	for (;;) {
		if (!(tmp = READ_ONCE(a)))
			break;
		do_something_with(tmp);
		if (!(tmp = READ_ONCE(a)))
			break;
		do_something_with(tmp);
		if (!(tmp = READ_ONCE(a)))
			break;
		do_something_with(tmp);
		if (!(tmp = READ_ONCE(a)))
			break;
		do_something_with(tmp);
	}
</pre>

<p>
Note that use of the new <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>
macros are recommended for new code, in fact, <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt>
has been phased out as of v4.15.
Of course, this phase-out has the advantage that
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> are a better
match for the C and C++ <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> loads and
stores, give or take volatility.
</p>

<p>
At one time, <tt>gcc</tt> guaranteed that properly aligned accesses
to machine-word-sized variables would be atomic.
Although <tt>gcc</tt> no longer documents this guarantee, there is
still code in the Linux kernel that relies on it.
These accesses could be modeled as non-<tt>volatile</tt>
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> accesses.
</p>

<p>
The Linux kernel provides <tt>atomic_t</tt> and
<tt>atomic_long_t</tt> types.
These have <tt>atomic_read()</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_read()</tt>
operations that provide non-RMW loads from the underlying variable.
They also have
<tt>atomic_set()</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_set()</tt>
operations that provide non-RMW stores into the the underlying
variable.
These were originally intended for single-threaded initialization-time
and cleanup-time accesses to atomic variables, however, they have
since been adapted to operate in a manner similar to
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> loads and stores.

<p>
The <tt>atomic_t</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_t</tt> types
have quite a few other operations that are described in the
&ldquo;Atomic Operations&rdquo; section.
These types could potentially be modeled as volatile atomic <tt>int</tt>
for <tt>atomic_t</tt> and volatile atomic <tt>long</tt> for
<tt>atomic_long_t</tt>, however, anyone using such a strategy could
expect great scrutiny of the code generated at initialization time,
when there is no possibility of concurrent access.
(Implementations that implement aligned machine-word-sized relaxed atomic
loads and stores as normal load and store instructions will pass scrutiny,
at least assuming that pointers are machine-word-sized.)
</p>

<p>
An <tt>smp_store_release()</tt> may be modeled as a
<tt>volatile</tt> <tt>memory_order_release</tt> store.
Similarly, an <tt>smp_load_acquire()</tt> may be modeled as a
volatile <tt>memory_order_acquire</tt> load.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
r1 = smp_load_acquire(x);
smp_store_release(y, 1);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Members of the <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> family can be modeled
as <tt>memory_order_consume</tt> loads.
Members of this family include:
<tt>rcu_dereference()</tt>,
<tt>rcu_dereference_bh()</tt>,
<tt>rcu_dereference_sched()</tt>,
<tt>srcu_dereference()</tt>, and
<tt>lockless_dereference()</tt>.
However, <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> should be representative for
litmus-test purposes, at least initially.
Similarly, <tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt> can be modeled as a
<tt>memory_order_release</tt> store.
(That said, if <tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt> is storing a <tt>NULL</tt>
or a pointer to constant data, for example, compile-time initialized data,
then <tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt> may be modeled as a
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> store.)
</p>

<p>
The <tt>set_mb()</tt> function assigns the specified value to the
specified variable, then executes a full memory barrier, which is
described in the next section.
This isn't as strong as a <tt>memory_order_seq_cst</tt> store because
the following code fragment does not guarantee that the stores to
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> will be ordered.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
smp_store_release(x, 1);
set_mb(y, 1);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
That said, <tt>set_mb()</tt> provides exactly the ordering required
for manipulating task state, which is the job for which it was created.
</p>

<h2><a name="Memory Barriers">Memory Barriers</a></h2>

<p>
The Linux kernel has a variety of memory barriers:
</p>

<ol>
<li>	<tt>barrier()</tt>, which can be modeled as an
	<tt>atomic_signal_fence(memory_order_acq_rel)</tt>
	or an <tt>atomic_signal_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)</tt>.
<li>	<tt>smp_mb()</tt>, which does not have a direct C11 or
	C++11 counterpart.
	On an ARM, PowerPC, or x86 system, it can be modeled as a full
	memory-barrier instruction (<tt>dmb</tt>, <tt>sync</tt>,
	and <tt>mfence</tt>, respectively).
	On an Itanium system, it can be modeled as an <tt>mf</tt>
	instruction, but this relies on <tt>gcc</tt> emitting
	an <tt>ld.acq</tt> for an <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>
	and an <tt>st.rel</tt> for an <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>.
	(Peter Zijlstra of Intel notes that although IA64's reference
	manual claims instructions with acquire and release semantics,
	the actual hardware implements only full barriers.
	See commit e4f9bfb3feae (&ldquo;ia64: Fix up
	smp_mb__{before,after}_clear_bit()&rdquo;) for Linux-kernel
	changes based on this situation.
	Tony Luck and Fenghua Yu are the IA64 maintainers for the Linux
	kernel.)
<li>	<tt>smp_rmb()</tt>, which can be modeled (overly
	conservatively) as an
	<tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_acq_rel)</tt>.
	One difference is that <tt>smp_rmb()</tt> need not
	order prior loads against later stores, or prior stores against
	later stores.
	Another difference is that <tt>smp_rmb()</tt> need not provide
	any sort of transitivity, having (lack of) transitivity properties
	similar to ARM's or PowerPC's address/control/data dependencies.
<li>	<tt>smp_wmb()</tt>, which can be modeled (again overly
	conservatively) as an
	<tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_acq_rel)</tt>.
	One difference is that <tt>smp_wmb()</tt> need not
	order prior loads against later stores, nor prior loads against
	later loads.
	Similar to <tt>smp_rmb()</tt>, <tt>smp_wmb()</tt> need
	not provide any sort of transitivity.
<li>	<tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt>, which is a no-op on
	all architectures other than Alpha.
	On Alpha, <tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt> may be modeled
	as a <tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_acq_rel)</tt> or
	as a <tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)</tt>.
	As of v4.16 of the Linux kernel, <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>
	includes an <tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt>, which
	means that <tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt> should not
	be needed in any other non-Alpha-specific code.
<li>	<tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt>, which provides a full
	memory barrier before the immediately following non-value-returning
	atomic operation.
<li>	<tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt>, which provides a full
	memory barrier after the immediately preceding non-value-returning
	atomic operation.
	Both <tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt> and
	<tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt> are described in more
	detail in the later section on atomic operations.
<li>	<tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>, which provides a full
	memory barrier after the immediately preceding lock
	operation, but only when paired with a preceding unlock operation
	by this same thread or a preceding unlock operation on the same
	lock variable.
	The use of <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt> is described
	in more detail in the section on locking.
<li>	<tt>smp_mb__after_spinlock()</tt>, which provides full ordering
	after lock acquisition.
	The ordering guarantees of <tt>smp_mb__after_spinlock()</tt> are
	a strict superset of those of <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>.
</ol>

<p>
There are some additional memory barriers including <tt>mmiowb()</tt>,
however, these cover interactions with memory-mapped I/O, so have no
counterpart in C11 and C++11 (which is most likely as it should be for
the foreseeable future).
</p>

<p>
Some use cases for these memory barriers may be found
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/573436/">here</a>.
These are for the userspace RCU library, so drop the leading <tt>cmm_</tt>
to get the corresponding Linux-kernel primitive.
For example, the userspace <tt>cmm_smp_mb()</tt> primitive
translates to the Linux-kernel <tt>smp_mb()</tt> primitive.
</p>

<h2><a name="Locking Operations">Locking Operations</a></h2>

<p>
The Linux kernel features &ldquo;roach motel&rdquo; ordering on
its locking primitives:
Prior operations can be reordered to follow a later acquire,
and subsequent operations can be reordered to precede an
earlier release.
The CPU is permitted to reorder acquire and release operations in
this way, but the compiler is not, as compiler-based reordering could
result in deadlock.
</p>

<p>
Note that a release-acquire pair does not necessarily result in a
full barrier.
To see this consider the following litmus test, with <tt>x</tt>
and <tt>y</tt> both initially zero, and locks <tt>l1</tt>
and <tt>l3</tt> both initially held by the threads releasing them:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Thread 1                      Thread 2
--------                      --------
y = 1;                        x = 1;
spin_unlock(&amp;l1);             spin_unlock(&amp;l3);
spin_lock(&amp;l2);               spin_lock(&amp;l4);
r1 = x;                       r2 = y;

assert(r1 != 0 || r2 != 0);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the above litmus test, the assertion can trigger, meaning that an
unlock followed by a lock is not guaranteed to be a full memory barrier.
And this is where <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt> comes in:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Thread 1                      Thread 2
--------                      --------
y = 1;                        x = 1;
spin_unlock(&amp;l1);             spin_unlock(&amp;l3);
spin_lock(&amp;l2);               spin_lock(&amp;l4);
smp_mb__after_unlock_lock();  smp_mb__after_unlock_lock();
r1 = x;                       r2 = y;

assert(r1 != 0 || r2 != 0);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, after addition of <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>,
the assertion cannot trigger.
</p>

<p>
The above example showed how <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>
can cause an unlock-lock sequence in the same thread to act as a full
barrier, but it also applies in cases where one thread unlocks and
another thread locks the same lock, as shown below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Thread 1              Thread 2                        Thread 3
--------              --------                        --------
y = 1;                spin_lock(&amp;l1);                 x = 1;
spin_unlock(&amp;l1);     smp_mb__after_unlock_lock();    smp_mb();
                      r1 = y;                         r3 = y;
                      r2 = x;

assert(r1 == 0 || r2 != 0 || r3 != 0);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Without the <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>, the above assertion
can trigger, and with it, it cannot.
The fact that it can trigger without might seem strange at first glance,
but locks are only guaranteed to give sequentially consistent ordering
to their critical sections.
If you want an observer thread to see the ordering without holding
the lock, you need <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>.
(Note that there is some possibility that the Linux kernel's memory
model will change such that an unlock followed by a lock forms
a full memory barrier even without the
<tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>.)
</p>

<p>
The <tt>smp_mb__after_spinlock()</tt> barrier is similar to
<tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>, but also guarantees to order
accesses preceding the lock acquisition.
Only PowerPC needs a non-empty <tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt>,
but a non-empty <tt>smp_mb__after_spinlock()</tt> is required by
PowerPC, ARMv8, and RISC-V.
</p>

<p>
The Linux kernel has an embarrassingly large number of locking primitives,
but <tt>spin_lock()</tt> and <tt>spin_unlock()</tt> should be
representative for litmus-test purposes, at least initially.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly enough, the Linux kernel's locking operations can
be argued to be weaker than those of C11.
This argument is based on interpretation of 29.3p3 of the C++11
standard, which states in a non-normative note:

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Although it is not explicitly required that S include locks,
	it can always be extended to an order that does include lock and
	unlock operations, since the ordering between those is already
	included in the &ldquo;happens before&rdquo; ordering.
</blockquote>

<p>
That said,
<a href="http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/">current C11 formal memory models</a>
specify locking primitives to have roughly the same strength as those
of the Linux kernel, based on the following two litmus tests:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 int main()
 2 {
 3     atomic_int x = 0;
 4     atomic_int y = 0;
 5     mutex m1;
 6     mutex m2;
 7     mutex m3;
 8     mutex m4;
 9
10     {{{ { m1.lock();
11           y.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);
12           m1.unlock();
13           m2.lock();
14           r1 = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);
15           m2.unlock(); }
16
17     ||| { m3.lock();
18           x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);
19           m3.unlock();
20           m4.lock();
21           r2 = y.load(memory_order_relaxed);
22           m4.unlock(); }
23     }}};
24
25     return 0;
26 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This first litmus test can observe both <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt>
equal to zero, which would be prohibited if locking primitives enforced
SC behavior.

<p>
The second litmus test substitutes a fence for one of the
unlock-lock pairs:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int main()
 1 {
 2     atomic_int x = 0;
 3     atomic_int y = 0;
 4     mutex mtx;
 5
 6     {{{ { mtx.lock();
 7           x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);
 8           mtx.unlock();
 9           mtx.lock();
10           r0 = y.load(memory_order_relaxed);
11           mtx.unlock(); }
12
13     ||| { y.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);
14           atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);
15           r1 = x.load(memory_order_relaxed); }
16     }}};
17
18     return 0;
19 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This second litmus test can also observe both <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt>
equal to zero, which again would be prohibited if locking primitives
enforced SC behavior.

<p>
It is quite possible that the Linux kernel's locking primitives
will be strengthened so that an unlock-lock pair implies a full
memory barrier.
However, the pair of obscure Linux-kernel primitives named
<tt>spin_unlock_wait()</tt> and <tt>queued_spin_unlock_wait()</tt>
that might have directly motivated this change have been dropped
from the Linux kernel, primarily due to the fact that an attempt
to precisely define their semantics converged on them being
equivalent to a lock acquisition immediately followed by a
lock release.
The calls to these functions were therefore replaced by a
lock acquisition/release pair.

<p>
If this lock strengthening happens, the shoe will be on the other foot,
so that an alternative interpretation of 29.3p3 would provide weaker
C11 locking primitives.

<h2><a name="Atomic Operations">Atomic Operations</a></h2>

<p>
Atomic operations have three sets of operations,
those that are defined on <tt>atomic_t</tt>,
those that are defined on <tt>atomic_long_t</tt>,
and those that are defined on aligned machine-sized variables, currently
restricted to <tt>int</tt> and <tt>long</tt>.
However, in the near term, it should be acceptable to focus on a
small subset of these operations.
</p>

<p>
Variables of type <tt>atomic_t</tt> may be stored to
using <tt>atomic_set()</tt> and variables of type
<tt>atomic_long_t</tt> may be stored to using
<tt>atomic_long_set()</tt>.
Similarly, variables of these types may be loaded from using
<tt>atomic_read()</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_read()</tt>.
The historical definition of these primitives has lacked any
sort of concurrency-safe semantics, so the user is responsible
for ensuring that these primitives are not used concurrently
in a conflicting manner.
</p>

<p>
That said, many architectures treat <tt>atomic_read()</tt> and
<tt>atomic_long_read()</tt> as <tt>volatile</tt>
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> loads and a few architectures
treat <tt>atomic_set()</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_set()</tt>
as <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> stores.
There is therefore some chance that concurrent conflicting accesses
will be allowed at some point in the future, at which point
their semantics will be those of <tt>volatile</tt>
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> accesses.
However, as noted earlier, any attempt to implement
<tt>atomic_t</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_t</tt> as
volatile atomic <tt>int</tt> and <tt>long</tt>
can expect great scrutiny of the code generated in cases such as
initialization where no concurrent accesses are possible.
</p>

<p>
The remaining atomic operations are divided into those that return
a value and those that do not.
The atomic operations that do not return a value are similar to
C11 atomic <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> operations.
However, the Linux-kernel atomic operations that do return a value cannot be
implemented in terms of the C11 atomic operations.
These operations can instead be modeled as <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt>
operations that are both preceded and followed by the Linux-kernel
<tt>smp_mb()</tt> full memory barrier, which is implemented using
the <tt>DMB</tt> instruction on ARM and
the <tt>sync</tt> instruction on PowerPC.
Alternatively, if appropriate, <tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt>
and <tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt> could be used in place of
<tt>smp_mb()</tt>.
Note that in the case of the CAS operations <tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt>,
<tt>atomic_long_cmpxchg</tt>, and <tt>cmpxchg()</tt>, the
full barriers are required only in the success case as v4.3
(before that, full barriers were required in both cases).
Strong memory ordering can be added to the non-value-returning atomic
operations using <tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt> before and/or
<tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt> after.
</p>

<p>
For some of the value-returning atomic operations, there are also sets of
variants introduced in v4.4. These variants use suffixes to indicate their
ordering guarantees. There are three kinds of variants: <tt>_relaxed</tt>,
<tt>_acquire</tt> and <tt>_release</tt>, and they are similar to the
corresponding C11 <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt>,
<tt>memory_order_acquire</tt> and <tt>memory_order_release</tt> atomic
operations, except that they are volatile, which means they won't be optimized
out or merged with other atomic operations.  Note that in the case of the
variants of CAS operations <tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt>,
<tt>atomic_long_cmpxchg</tt>, and <tt>cmpxchg()</tt>, the ordering
guarantees are required only in the success case.
</p>

<p>
Note that C11 compilers are within their rights to assume data-race
freedom when determining what optimizations to carry out.
This will break the still-common Linux-kernel practice of assuming relaxed
semantics for normal accesses to non-atomic variables, hence the suggestions
to disable code-motion optimizations across atomics using full barriers
and/or Linux-kernel <tt>barrier()</tt> macros.
</p>

<p>
The operations are summarized in the following table.
An initial implementation of a tool could start with <tt>atomic_add()</tt>,
<tt>atomic_sub()</tt>, <tt>atomic_xchg()</tt>, and
<tt>atomic_cmpxchg()</tt>.

<p>
The rows marked &ldquo;(Generic)&rdquo; are type-generic, applying to any
aligned machine-word-sized quantity supported by all architectures that the
Linux kernel runs on.
The set of types is currently those of size <tt>int</tt> and
those of size <tt>long</tt>.
The &ldquo;Lock-Barrier Operations&rdquo; have <tt>memory_order_acquire</tt>
semantics for <tt>test_and_set_bit_lock()</tt> and
<tt>_atomic_dec_and_lock()</tt>, and have
<tt>memory_order_release</tt> for the other primitives.
Otherwise, the usual Linux-kernel rule holds: If no value is returned,
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> semantics apply, otherwise the operations
behave as if there was <tt>smp_mb()</tt> before and after.  And for those
value-returning primitives, the rows marked &ldquo;(Variants Available)&rdquo;
have <tt>_relaxed</tt>/<tt>_acquire</tt>/<tt>_release</tt>
variants, whereas the rows marked &ldquo;(No Variants)&rdquo; don't.

The bit test/set/clear and lock-barrier operations map to atomic
bit operations, but accept very large bit numbers.
The upper bits of the bit number select the <tt>unsigned long</tt>
element of an array, and the lower bits select the bit to operate on
within the selected <tt>unsigned long</tt>.

<h2><a name="Control Dependencies">Control Dependencies</a></h2>

<p>
The Linux kernel provides a limited notion of control dependencies,
ordering prior loads against control-dependent stores in some
cases.
Extreme care is required to avoid control-dependency-destroying compiler
optimizations.
The restrictions applying to control dependencies include the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>	Control dependencies can order prior loads against later
	dependent stores, however, they do <i>not</i> order
	prior loads against later dependent loads.
	(Use <tt>memory_order_consume</tt> or
	<tt>memory_order_acquire</tt> if you require this behavior.)
<li>	A load heading up a control dependency must use
	<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>.
	Similarly, the store at the other end of a control dependency
	must also use <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>.
	As of v4.16 of the Linux kernel, <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>
	can also head address and data dependency chains, which
	allowed Alpha-specific code to be removed from almost all
	of the core kernel.
<li>	If both legs of a given <tt>if</tt> or <tt>switch</tt>
	statement store the same value to the same variable, then
	those stores cannot participate in control-dependency ordering.
<li>	Control dependencies require at least one run-time conditional
	that depends on the prior load and that precedes the following
	store.
<li>	The compiler must perceive both the variable loaded from and
	the variable stored to as being shared variables.
	For example, the compiler will not perceive an on-stack variable
	as being shared unless its address has been taken and exported
	to some other thread (or alias analysis has otherwise been
	defeated).
<li>	Control dependencies are not transitive.
	In this regard, their behavior is similar to ARM or PowerPC
	control dependencies.
</ol>

<p>
The C and C++ standards do not guarantee any sort of control dependency.
Therefore, this list of restriction is subject to change as compilers become
increasingly clever and aggressive.
</p>

<h2><a name="RCU Grace-Period Relationships">RCU Grace-Period Relationships</a></h2>

<p>
The publish-subscribe portions of RCU are captured by the combination
of <tt>rcu_assign_pointer()</tt>, which can be modeled as a
<tt>memory_order_release</tt> store, and of the
<tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> family of primitives, which can be
modeled as <tt>memory_order_consume</tt> loads, as was noted
earlier.
</p>

<p>
Grace periods can be modeled as described in Appendix&nbsp;D of
<a href="http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/dl/trans/td/2012/02/extras/ttd2012020375s.pdf">User-Level Implementations of Read-Copy Update</a>.
There are a number of grace-period primitives in the Linux kernel,
but <tt>rcu_read_lock()</tt>, <tt>rcu_read_unlock()</tt>,
and <tt>synchronize_rcu()</tt> are good places to start.
The grace-period relationships can be describe using the following
abstract litmus test:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Thread 1                      Thread 2
--------                      --------
rcu_read_lock();              S2a;
S1a;                          synchronize_rcu();
S1b;                          S2b;
rcu_read_unlock();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If either of <tt>S1a</tt> or <tt>S1b</tt> precedes <tt>S2a</tt>,
then both must precede <tt>S2b</tt>.
Conversely, if either of <tt>S1a</tt> or <tt>S1b</tt> follows
<tt>S2b</tt>, then both must follow <tt>S2a</tt>.
Additional litmus tests may be found
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/573497/">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0868r0.pdf">here</a>.
For the litmus tests using the userspace RCU library, drop the leading
<tt>cmm_</tt> to get the corresponding Linux-kernel primitives.
</p>

<p>
Given a high-quality implementation of <tt>memory_order_consume</tt>,
RCU can be implemented as a library.

<h3><a name="ACCESS_ONCE()"><tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt></a></h3>

<p>
There is no C11 syntax corresponding to <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt>,
which enables both loads and stores.
However, this problem was solved by the removal of
<tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> from v4.15 of the
Linux kernel in favor of
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, which are described
below.

<h3><a name="READ_ONCE()"><tt>READ_ONCE()</tt></a></h3>

<p>
Although the semantics of <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> are tantalizingly close
to those of a C11 <tt>volatile</tt> <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> atomic
read, there are important differences:

<ol>
<li>	<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> can head an address, data, or control
	dependency chain.
	This is of course more like <tt>memory_order_consume</tt>
	load, but all known implementations promote such loads to
	<tt>memory_order_acquire</tt>, which is stronger than needed
	by <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>.
<li>	<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> is permitted to tear when used on objects
	too large for the available load instructions.
	(And yes, there are parts of the Linux kernel that use
	<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> in situations where it must tear,
	and these users would be decidedly unamused by invention and
	use of locks by the compiler.)
</ol>

<p>
Therefore, <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> cannot be implemented in terms
of C11 atomics.

<h3><a name="WRITE_ONCE()"><tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt></a></h3>

<p>
The semantics of <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> are also quite close
to those of a C11 <tt>volatile</tt> <tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt> atomic
store.
However, as with <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> is
permitted to tear when used on objects too large for the available
store instructions.
(And yes, there are parts of the Linux kernel that use
<tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> in situations where it must tear, and these users
would be decidedly unamused by invention and use of locks by the
compiler.)

<p>
Therefore, <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> cannot be implemented in terms
of C11 atomics.

<h3><a name="smp_mb()"><tt>smp_mb()</tt></a></h3>

<p>
Quoting 29.3p8 of the C++11 standard:

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Fences cannot, in general, be used to restore sequential
	consistency for atomic operations with weaker ordering
	specifications.
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, <tt>smp_mb()</tt> guarantees to restore sequential consistency
among accesses that use <tt>READ_ONCE</tt>,
<tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt>, or stronger.
For example, the following Linux-kernel code would forbid non-SC
outcomes:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 int x, y, r0, r1, r2, r3;
 2 
 3 void thread0(void)
 4 {
 5   WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
 6 }
 7 
 8 void thread1(void)
 9 {
10   WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
11 }
12 
13 void thread2(void)
14 {
15   r0 = READ_ONCE(x);
16   smp_mb()
17   r1 = READ_ONCE(y);
18 }
19 
20 void thread3(void)
21 {
22   r2 = READ_ONCE(y);
23   smp_mb()
24   r3 = READ_ONCE(x);
25 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, the closest C11 analog
can permit the non-SC outcomes and still conform to the standard:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 atomic_int x, y;
 2 int r0, r1, r2, r3;
 3 
 4 void thread0(void)
 5 {
 6   atomic_store_explicit(x, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
 7 }
 8 
 9 void thread1(void)
10 {
11   atomic_store_explicit(y, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
12 }
13 
14 void thread2(void)
15 {
16   r0 = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_relaxed);
17   atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);
18   r1 = atomic_load_explicit(y, memory_order_relaxed);
19 }
20 
21 void thread3(void)
22 {
23   r2 = atomic_load_explicit(y, memory_order_relaxed);
24   atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst);
25   r3 = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_relaxed);
26 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
That said, it is not clear that anything in the Linux kernel cares
whether or not sequential consistency is restored.

<h3><a name="smp_read_barrier_depends()"><tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt></a></h3>

<p>
Although it is legal C11 to say
&ldquo;<tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_consume)</tt>&rdquo;,
all known C11 implementations promote this to an acquire fence.
Within the Linux kernel, this would have the undesirable effect of
promoting <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> to acquire as well.
Linux therefore needs to continue defining
<tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt>
as <tt>smp_mb()</tt> on DEC Alpha and nothingness elsewhere.

<p>
Note again that as of v4.16 of the Linux kernel, <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt>
includes <tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt>, which means that
<tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt> should not be needed anywhere
else in the Linux kernel aside from Alpha-specific code.

<h3><a name="Locking Operations">Locking Operations</a></h3>

<p>
Consider the following litmus test:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 void thread0(void)
 2 {
 3   spin_lock(&amp;my_lock);
 4   WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
 5   spin_unlock(&amp;my_lock);
 6   spin_lock(&amp;my_lock);
 7   r0 = READ_ONCE(y);
 8   spin_unlock(&amp;my_lock);
 9 }
10 
11 void thread1(void)
12 {
13   WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
14   smp_mb();
15   r1 = READ_ONCE(x);
16 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Linux kernel is currently within its rights to arrive at the
non-SC outcome <tt>r0 == 0 &amp;&amp; r1 == 0</tt>.
This might change in the near future.
One or the other of these states will be inconsistent with C11.

<h3><a name="Value-Returning Atomics">Value-Returning Atomics</a></h3>

<p>
Linux's value-returning atomics provide unconditional ordering.
For example, in the following code fragment, the outcome 
<tt>r0 == 1 &amp;&amp; r1 == 0</tt> is forbidden:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 int x, y, z, dummy;
 2 int r0 = 42;
 3 int r1 = 43;
 4 
 5 void thread0(void)
 6 {
 7   WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
 8   dummy = xchg(&amp;z, 1);
 9   WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
10 }
11 
12 void thread1(void)
13 {
14   r0 = smp_load_acquire(&amp;y);
15   r1 = READ_ONCE(x);
16 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, the closest C11 analog (from David Majnemer and
analyzed by Chandler Carruth) does not prohibit this outcome:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 atomic_int x, y, z;
 2 int r0 = 42;
 3 int r1 = 43;
 4 
 5 void thread0(void)
 6 {
 7   atomic_store_explicit(x, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
 8   atomic_store_explicit(z, 1, memory_order_seq_cst);
 9   atomic_store_explicit(y, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
10 }
11 
12 void thread1(void)
13 {
14   r0 = atomic_load_explicit(y, memory_order_acquire);
15   r1 = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_relaxed);
16 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that this category includes non-value-returning atomics enclosed within
<tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt>/<tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt> pairs.
For example, the Linux-kernel variant of <tt>thread0()</tt> could
be written as follows with the same outcome, assuming that <tt>z</tt>
is declared as <tt>atomic_t</tt> instead of <tt>int</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 void thread0(void)
 2 {
 3   WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
 4   smp_mb__before_atomic();
 5   atomic_inc(&amp;z);
 6   smp_mb__after_atomic();
 7   WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
 8 }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Control Dependencies">Control Dependencies</a></h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel provides control dependencies and C11 does not,
so <tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> must either retain its current
implementation or must be promoted to acquire.

<h2><a name="So You Want Your Arch To Use C11 Atomics...">So You Want Your Arch To Use C11 Atomics...</a></h2>

<p>
So suppose that you want your Linux-kernel architecture to use C11 atomics.
How should you go about it?
This section looks at three scenarios:
(1)&nbsp;A new architecture,
(2)&nbsp;Partial conversion of an existing architecture, and
(3)&nbsp;Full conversion of an existing architecture.
Each of these is covered by one of the following sections.
</p>

<h3><a name="New Architecture">New Architecture</a></h3>

<p>
The potential advantages of using the C11 memory model for a new
architecture include:
</p>

<ol>
<li>	Delegating implementation of atomic primitives to the compiler.
<li>	If multiple architectures take this approach, a reduction in
	the amount of architecture-specific code.
<li>	The compiler can undertake more optimizations.
	It is left to the reader to decide whether this would be an
	advantage or a disadvantage.
</ol>

<p>
<tt>READ_ONCE()</tt> and <tt>WRITE_ONCE()</tt> should continue to use the
existing definitions in order to avoid the C11-mandated use of locking
for oversized objects.
(As should <tt>ACCESS_ONCE()</tt> in pre-v4.15 kernels.)
</p>

<p>
Memory barriers could be implemented in terms of the C11
<tt>atomic_signal_fence()</tt> and <tt>atomic_thread_fence()</tt>
functions as follows:
</p>

<table cellpadding="3" border=3>
<tbody><tr><th>Linux Operation</th>
    <th>C11 Implementation</th>
</tr>
<tr class="Even"><th align="left"><tt>barrier()</tt></th>
    <td><tt>atomic_signal_fence(memory_order_seq_cst()</tt> (if safe)<br>

    <td>Inline assembly otherwise<br>
<tr class="Even"><th align="left"><tt>smp_read_barrier_depends()</tt></th>
    <td>As in the Linux kernel<br>
<tr class="Odd"><th align="left"><tt>smp_mb__after_atomic()</tt>
				 <span style="font-weight:normal">and</span>
				 <tt>smp_mb__before_atomic()</tt></th>
    <td>Depends on implementation of non-value-returning
        read-modify-write operations<br>
<tr class="Odd"><th align="left"><tt>smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()</tt></th>
    <td>Depends on implementation of locking primitives<br>
<tr class="Odd"><th align="left"><tt>smp_mb__after_spinlock()</tt></th>
    <td>Depends on implementation of locking primitives<br>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The Linux kernel's locking primitives will likely need to remain as
hard-coded assembly for some time to come, particularly for the
locking primitives that interact with irq or bottom-half environments.
Over time, it might well prove that the compiler can generate
&ldquo;good enough&rdquo; locking primitives, but careful analysis
and inspection should be used to make that determination.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>atomic_t</tt> and <tt>atomic_long_t</tt> types could
be implemented as volatile atomic <tt>int</tt> and <tt>long</tt>.
However, this would require inspecting the code that the compiler emits
to ensure that the value-returning atomic read-modify-write primitives
provide full ordering both before and after, as required for the Linux
kernel.
Because the C11 compiler might perform optimizations that violate the
full-ordering requirement (optimizations based on the assumption of
data-race freedom being but one example), it would be wise to
add <tt>barrier()</tt> directives at the beginnings and ends of the
definitions of the value-returning atomic read-modify-write primitives.
This prevents the compiler from carrying out any code-motion optimizations
across the <tt>barrier()</tt> directive.
In addition, because the C11 compiler can in many cases optimize away
atomic operations whose results are not used, and their ordering properties
with them, it is wise to place
<tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)</tt>
before and after C11 atomics that are used to implement Linux-kernel
value-returning read-modify-write atomics.
Note that this assumes that the implementation in question provides
<tt>atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)</tt> ordering properties
compatible with <tt>smp_mb()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The generic atomic operations might be implemented by casting to
volatile atomic objects, and, failing that, inline assembly as
is currently used in the Linux kernel.
</p>

<p>
Until such time as the C11 memory model implements control dependencies,
the Linux kernel must implement them.
Similarly, RCU must currently also be implemented by the Linux kernel
rather than the compiler.
That said, TSO machines (for example, x86 and the mainframe) can use
volatile <tt>memory_order_consume</tt> loads to implement
the <tt>rcu_dereference()</tt> family of primitives without
incurring performance penalties.
</p>

<h3><a name="Partial Conversion of Existing Architecture">Partial Conversion of Existing Architecture</a></h3>

<p>
In some sense, a new architecture has less to lose by letting the
compiler have a go at implementing atomic operations and memory barriers.
In contrast, an existing architecture likely already has well-tested
high-performance primitives implemented with inline assembly.
Not only that, existing architectures might need to support older
compilers that do not have robust implementations of C11 atomics.
Therefore, any change to C11 should be implemented cautiously, if at all.
One way of proceeding cautiously is to do a partial conversion, preferably
permitting easy fallback to the original inline assembly.
The non-value-returning read-modify-write atomics are likely the
safest and easiest C11 primitives to start with.
</p>

<h3><a name="Full Conversion of Existing Architecture">Full Conversion of Existing Architecture</a></h3>

<p>
Full conversion of an existing architecture to C11 requires even more
bravery, to say nothing of more complete validation of the relevant
C11 functions.
For example, it would be wise to provide a Kconfig option selecting
between the existing inline assembly and the C11 atomics.
This would permit continued use of old compilers where needed, and
also allow users to decide when they are ready to trust C11.
It would also be wise to look into David Howells's experimental
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/691128/">conversion of the Linux kernel x86 architecture to C11 atomics</a>.

<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This document makes a first attempt to present a formalizable model of
the Linux kernel memory model, including variable access, memory barriers,
locking operations, atomic operations, control dependencies, and
RCU grace-period relationships.
The general approach is to reduce the kernel's memory model to some
aspect of memory models that have already been formalized, in particular
to those of C11, C++11, ARM, and PowerPC.
A formal Linux-kernel memory model has been accepted into the mainline
Linux kernel as of April 2, 2018 in the <tt>tools/memory-model</tt>
directory, and the corresponding
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3173162.3177156">paper</a>
has also been presented at
<a href="https://www.asplos2018.org/">ASPLOS 2018</a>.
