    <h1>A new specification for <code>std::generate_canonical</code></h1>

    <p>This paper proposes a new specification for the function template
      <code>generate_canonical</code> [rand.util.canonical, 29.6.7.2]. The outcome is preserved
      (namely a random number in the interval [0, 1)), but the algorithm and the constraints are
      changed to ensure the desired statistical properties. The new specification
      obsoletes <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue2524">LWG 2524</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="problem">Problem statement</h2>

    <p>The specification of <code>generate_canonical</code> in C++17 and in the current working
      paper (N4713) is effectively unimplementable since it is over-constrained. To be more
      precise, it is <em>wrongly</em> constrained in terms of purely mathematical expressions
      that ignore the reality of floating point rounding on real implementations. We will point
      out two problems with the current specification. The first one is immediate, the second is
      somewhat more subtle and will be discussed later in this paper. First, consider the the
      following three current requirements.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The result must lie in [0, 1).</li>
      <li>The algorithm is specified exactly and the underlying URBG must be invoked a specific,
      fixed number of times for a given set of parameters.</li>
      <li>The results must be uniformly distributed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The immediate problem is that this is unimplementable for the following reasons: The
      algorithm is currently specified exactly as a particular computation, which results in a
      fraction
      <em>S</em>/<em>R</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> that is mathematically guaranteed to be less
      than 1. However, the value may be arbitrarily close to 1, and when expressed as a value of
      a bounded-precision type in C++, the result may actually be exactly 1 due to rounding.
      (This causes real bugs, e.g. when a computation divides by <code>(1&nbsp;-&nbsp;x)</code>, where
      <code>x</code> was obtained from <code>generate_canonical</code>.) If we accept (2), the
      algorithm as written, the rounding violates constraint (1). If we modify the result when
      the algorithm results in 1, we violate (3), uniformity. If we want to preserve (1) and (3),
      we need to rerun the algorithm in the case where it results in 1, which violates (2), the
      precise computational prescription.</p>

    <p>LWG decided at the 2017 Albuquerque meeting that the best solution is to change the
      specification to rerun the algorithm until the result is not equal to 1. This means that
      the complexity of the algorithm can no longer be stated precisely, but only in
      expectation.  If one round of the algorithm invokes the URBG <em>k</em> times, and the
      result is 1 with probability (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;p), then the expected number of
      invocations of the URBG is now <em>k</em>/<em>p</em>. (In practice, <em>p</em> will be
      very close to (and less than) 1.) This paper attempts to improve on that decision by
      also addressing some</p>

    <h2 id="driveby">Drive-by fixes</h2>

    <p>The original expression for <em>b</em> assumes that the radix is 2 when using
      <code>numeric_limits&lt;RealType&gt;::digits</code> as a bit count. We propose
      to use the more general expression log<sub>2</sub>(<code>numeric_limits&lt;RealType&gt;::radix</code>)
      &times; <code>numeric_limits&lt;RealType&gt;::digits</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="notwording">DO NOT SUBMIT: Proposed naive wording</h2>

    <p>If we simplify modified the specification to rerun the algorithm until it results in a
      value less than 1, we could use the following wording. However, this wording fails to address
      the deeper statistical problems that we will discuss below, so we do not want to keep the
      change as small as this. This section is included solely for historical interest because this
      wording has been discussed on the reflector before.</p>

    <h2 id="flaws">Statistical flaws in the current specification</h2>

    <p>The currently specified algorithm does not always result in uniform output due to
      rounding. To see this, consider first a simple lemma.</p>

    <p><strong>Claim.</strong> <em>The restriction of a uniform distribution on a finite
    set to a subset is uniform.</em>&#x220E;</p>

    <p>We use this to look for statistical properties of <code>generate_canonical</code>. If
      the function generates uniformly distributed floats in the range [0, 1), then by throwing
      away all numbers less than 0.5, we retain a uniform distribution on the set [0.5, 1). In
      the popular IEEE-754 floating-point representation, numbers in this range have a fixed
      exponent (of effective value &minus;1), and so we get a uniform distribution of mantissas,
      and thus each bit of the mantissa (or perhaps of a leading subset of significant bits, when
      the algorithm is used with low precision) is independently uniformly distributed.
      This is a property we can look for. More generally, similar statements should hold for restrictions
      to intervals of the form [2<sup>&minus;<em>n</em></sup>, 2<sup>&minus;<em>n</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>).</p>

    <p>The problem in the current specification comes from the use of division combined with
      floating point rounding. Whenever a larger range is used to derive a smaller range via
      division (rather than just discarding bits, when that is an option), the floating point
      rounding behaviour affects the results. To illustrate, consider the sequence 0.0, 0.5,
      1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5. If we <em>discard</em> the least significant bit, we obtain 0, 0, 1,
      1, 2, 2, 3, 3, which is uniform. But if we employ the popular to-nearest-even rounding, we
      obtain 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, which biases even to odd numbers at a ratio of 3-to-1.
      (This also shows another bias, namely that 0 only gets hit twice.)</p>

    <p>To make this problem concrete, consider a typical 32-bit float with 24 mantissa digits.
      For an extreme case, if the URBG returns 25 bits, then in the restricted range [0.5, 1.0)
      the least significant bit results from rounding away the last digit of <em>g</em><sub>0</sub>
      in just the same way as in the previous example, which leads to a 3-to-1 bias of zeros over ones
      in the last bit. A 26-bit URBG would have to strip two bits in the range [0.5, 1.0) (leading to
      a 5-to-3 bias), but only one bit in the range [0.25, 0.5), and so on. With the typical 32-bit URBG,
      the bias in the last bit shows up when restricting to the range [2<sup>&minus;8</sup>, 2<sup>&minus;7</sup>) (or
      <code>[0x1p-8, 0x1p-7)</code> in code).</p>

    <p>Other rounding modes may be fairer when rounding is needed for random number generation.
      However, the rounding mode is not in scope of the specification and thus not under our
      control. More importantly, the algorithm we will propose will use discard-and-retry rather
      than division, and thus avoid any rounding by design.</p>

    <p>The problem with rounding to nearest-even was also discovered in
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextDouble--">the
      Java library&rsquo;s <code>nextDouble</code> function</a>, which originally used a
      non-trivial division and would thus experience a rounding-induced bias in the lowest bit.
      (In the corrected, present version, the division by <code>1L &lt;&lt; 53</code> is just a
      trivial exponent adjustment.)</p>

    <h2 id="newspec">A new specification</h2>

    <p>We propose a new specification that provably results in uniform output, does not suffer
      from rounding problems, and is independent of the radix of the floating point
      implementation. The algorithm does not use non-trivial division to produce a limited
      output range. Rather, it will discard any result that falls outside the desired range
      and retry, so that the final division does not round. This ensures uniformity and avoids
      any dependency on floating-point rounding behaviour.</p>

    <p>The set possible outcomes is not required to contain <em>every</em> representable
      value of <code>RealType</code> in the interval [0, 1). To do so would typically require
      an exponential amount of retries, as smaller results would need to be increasingly
      unlikely. Instead, the resulting values will be precisely the values 2<sup>&minus;<em>M</em></sup>{0,
      &hellip;, 2<sup><em>M</em></sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1}, where <em>M</em> is the value
      <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> defined below. For example, for <code>bits = 2</code>, the outcome is
      (uniformly) 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. Note also that the mean of the resulting distribution
      is smaller (by 2<sup>&minus;&nbsp;<em>M</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>) than the ideal mean 0.5.</p>

    <p>The proposed algorithm is as follows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Let <em>r</em> be <code>numeric_limits&lt;RealType&gt;::radix</code>,
        let <em>d</em> be <code>numeric_limits&lt;RealType&gt;::digits</code>,
        and let <em>R</em> be <code>g.max()</code>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<code>g.min()</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.</li>

      <li>Let <em>b</em> be the smallest integer such that
        <em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>&nbsp;&geq;&nbsp;2<sup><code>bits</code></sup>,
        but not larger than <em>d</em>.</li>

      <li>Let <em>k</em> be the smallest integer such that
        <em>R</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>&nbsp;&geq;&nbsp;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>.</li>

      <li>Let <em>x</em> be the largest integer such that
        <em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>&nbsp;&leq;&nbsp;<em>R</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>.
        Note that <em>x</em> need not be a power or <em>r</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now compute <em>S</em> = &sum;<sub><em>i</em></sub>
      <em>g</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>&#x202F;<em>R</em><sup><em>i</em></sup>
      in unbounded precision.
      Whenever <em>S</em> &geq; <em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>,
      discard the result and retry. The return value is
      <em>S</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;(<em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>),
      which can be computed without rounding, since <em>b</em>&nbsp;&leq;&nbsp;<em>d</em>.</p>

    <p>For the edge case <code>bits = 0</code>, we should always return 0 and not call the URBG;
      the results have zero entropy.</p>
    
    <p>Note that on the most common platforms <em>r</em> = 2
      and <em>R</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>
      is a power of 2, so that the definitions simplify:
      <em>b</em> = min(<code>bits</code>, <em>d</em>),
      <em>k</em> = &lceil;<em>b</em> / n&rceil;,
      and <em>x</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em><em>k</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>b</em></sup>.
      The final return expression is <em>S</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;2<sup><em>nk</em></sup>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;<em>S</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>R</em><sup><em>k</em></sup>.
      (That expression is the same as in the current specification, but <em>S</em> is chosen more carefully.)</p>

    <p>It is easy to see that this algorithm produces uniform outputs: The value
      <em>S</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> is obtained by restricting
      the URBG to the range [0, <em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>). Since <em>b</em> does not exceed
      the precision of <code>RealType</code>, the final division
      <em>S</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;/&nbsp;(<em>x</em>&#x202F;<em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>) does not round and is representable
      as a value of <code>RealType</code> strictly less than 1.</p>

    <h2 id="impact">Impact on the Standard</h2>

    <p>This proposal changes the side effects, computational complexity and specific algorithmic
      details of the library facility <code>std::generate_canonical</code>. In particular, code
      that depends on a specific sequence of results from repeated invocations, or on a particular
      number of calls to the URBG argument, will be broken.</p>

    <h2 id="questions">Questions for LWG and SG6</h2>

    <p>We would like clarification on the following details.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Is the design intention that <code>std::generate_canonical&lt;RealType, bits&gt;</code> picks
        an integer uniformly from [0, 2<sup><em>M</em></sup>) and returns the value divided by
        2<sup><em>M</em></sup>? This is in contrast to possible alternative interpretations such as &ldquo;pick
        a uniform real number (mathematically) from [0, 1) and return its rounded <code>RealType</code>
        representation&rdquo;. The latter suffers from the round-to-1.0 bug, of course, but it could be
        amended to &ldquo;round-down&rdquo; semantics to avoid this. However, the requirement of a mathematically
        uniform real number requires highly variable (and potentially large) number of URBG invocations, so we
        believe that this is not the design intent. (This has been the subject of some reflector discussion.)</li>

      <li>How much do we want to specify the algorithm? The above description is fairly detailed
        and prescriptive, which we intend to result in identical results on conforming implementations.
        However, for certain parameters our prescription requires more retries than strictly necessary.
        An alternative would be to give implementations more freedom to use more efficient sampling
        strategies; or we could consider <em>mandating</em> more efficient sampling, at the cost of
        making the specification more complex.</li>
    </ol>
