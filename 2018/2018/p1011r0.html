<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In &quot;Constant View: A proposal for a <code>std::as_const</code> helper function template&quot; (N4380), I (and Alisdair
Meredith) proposed a utility for the standard library to afford constant-view of a specific value,
by reference.  Since its adoption into C++17, we've learned a lot about how this utility can be used,
and we've discovered a new set of cases where a similar utility might be useful.  This paper outlines
that similar utility and the motivations for it.</p>
<p>We propose a new helper function template, <code>std::as_ptr_const</code>, which would live in the <code>&lt;utility&gt;</code>
header. A simple example usage:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;utility&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;

void
demoUsage()
{
    std::string mutableString= &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
    std::string *mutableStringPtr= &amp;mutableString
    const std::string &amp;constPtrView= std::as_ptr_const( mutableStringPtr );

    assert( &amp;constPtrView == mutableStringPtr );
    assert( std::as_ptr_const( mutableStringPtr ) == &amp;mutableString );

    assert( &amp;*constPtrView == &amp;std::as_const( mutableString ) );
    assert( *constPtrView == std::as_const( mutableString ) );
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The C++ Language distinguishes between <code>const Type *</code> and <code>Type *</code> in ADL lookup for selecting function overloads. The selection of
overloads can occur among functions like:</p>
<pre><code>int processEmployees( std::vector&lt; Employee &gt; *employeeList );
bool processEmployees( const std::vector&lt; Employee &gt; *employeeList );
</code></pre>
<p>Oftentimes these functions should have the same behavior, but sometimes free (or member) functions will return different types,
depending upon which qualifier (const or non-const) applies to the source type.  Further, the semantics of such functions could
differ drastically, depending upon whether the function knows that it has permission to modify the memory that was referenced.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This proposal shares essentially the same motivation as N4380, just expanded to include pointers, beyond references.  It would
be a breaking change to add an overload to <code>std::as_const</code> which handled pointers differently.  There are legitimate use
cases for the <code>std::as_const&lt; T *&amp; &gt;</code> case which would collide with an overload to effect this semantic.  Therefore I propose
a distinct name for this operation.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Consider developing a more generic &quot;safe-const-cast&quot; language idiom</li>
<li>Develop a more generic library utility for <code>T **</code>, <code>T ***</code>, and member pointers</li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This conversion, or alternative-viewpoint, is always safe. Following the rule that safe and common actions shouldn't be ugly while
dangerous and infrequent actions should be hard to write, we can conclude that this addition of const is an operation that should
not be ugly and hard. Const-cast syntax is ugly and therefore its usage is inherently eschewed.</p>
<p>We have deliberately chosen not to overload <code>std::as_const</code> for pointer cases, as there are legitimate use cases for references
to pointer which may exist today that shouldn't be broken.  Further, since the target of the pointer is the type being augmented
with const, not the pointer itself, an overload which declines to modify rvalues is not necessary, as pointers have different
semantics than references, when it comes to copying and lifetime extension rules.</p>
<h2>Proposed Implementation</h2>
<p>In the <code>&lt;utility&gt;</code> header, the following code should work:</p>
<pre><code>// ...
// -- Assuming that the file has reverted to the global namespace --
namespace std
{
    template&lt; typename T &gt;
    std::add_const&lt; T &gt;_t *
    as_ptr_const( T *const t ) noexcept
    {
        return t;
    }
}
// ...
</code></pre>
<h2>Further Discussion</h2>
<p>The return of my request to have a constant-view mechanism in the language or the library takes the
form of an operation over an expanded set of possible types.  It is probably worth investigating a more
general feature for this purpose, given that we've identified another set of types which would benefit
from a constant-view mechanism.  I request guidance from LEWG and LWG on whether there is value in
further investigatation of this kind of idea, and whether it should take the form of a language feature
or a library feature.</p>
