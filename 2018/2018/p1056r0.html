<h1>Add coroutine task type</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The coroutines TS has introduced a language capability that allows functions to be
suspended and later resumed. One of the key applications for this new feature is to make
it easier to write asynchronous code. However, the coroutines TS itself does not (yet) 
provide any types that directly support writing asynchronous code.
</p>
<p>
This paper proposes adding a new type, std::task&lt;T&gt;, to the standard library
to enable creation and composition of coroutines representing asynchronous computation. 

<!-- 
Similar to the std::future&gt;T&lt; type, the task&lt;T&gt; type represents an operation
that produces a either a single value or an exception asynchronously.
However, unlike std::future&gt;T&gt; that -->
</p>
<!--
<p>
Unlike std::future&lt;T&gt;, the std::task&lt;T&gt; type does not provide a 
publicly accessible promise object that can be used to produce the result. 
Instead, the result is produced by a coroutine function whose body eventually
executes a co_return statement or that completes with an unhandled exception.
</p>
-->
<pre>
  #include &lt;experimental/task&gt;
  #include &lt;string&gt;
  
  struct record
  {
    int id;
    std::string name;
    std::string description;
  };
  
  std::task&lt;record&gt; load_record(int id);
  std::task&lt;&gt; save_record(record r);
  
  std::task&lt;void&gt; modify_record()
  {
    record r = co_await load_record(123);
    r.description = “Look, ma, no blocking!”;
    co_await save_record(std::move(r));
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The interface of task is intentionally minimalistic and designed 
  for efficiency. In fact, the only operation you can do with the task
  is to await on it.
  <pre>
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    class [[nodiscard]] task {
    public:
      task(task&amp;&amp; rhs) noexcept;
      ~task();
      auto operator co_await(); <i>// exposition only</i>
    };      
  </pre>
  While such small interface may seem unusual at first, subsequent
  sections will clarify the rationale for this design.
  <!--
  In the following sections, we will go over some of the (possibly) unorthorox decisions at first, they were 
  chosen to make using tasks safer and to guide us
  -->
</p>
<h2>Why not use futures with future.then?</h2>
<p>
  The <code>std::future</code> type is inherently inefficient and cannot be used
  for efficient composition of asynchronous operations. The unavoidable  overhead
  of futures is due to:
  <ul>
    <li>allocation/deallocation of the shared state object</li>
    <li>atomic increment/decrement for managing the lifetime of the shared state object</li>
    <li>synchronization between setting of the result and getting the result</li>
    <li>(with .then) scheduling overhead of starting execution of subscribers to .then</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
   Consider the following example:
   <pre>
      task&lt;int&gt; coro() {
        int result = 0;
        while (int v = co_await async_read())
          result += v;
        co_return result;
      }    
  </pre>
  where <code>async_read()</code> is some asynchronous operation that takes, say 4ns, to 
  perform. We would like to factor out the logic into two    coroutines:
  <pre>
      task&lt;int&gt; subtask() { co_return co_await async_read(); }
        
      task&lt;int&gt; coro_refactored() {
        int result = 0;
        while (int v = co_await subtask())
          result += v;
        co_return result;
      }    
  </pre>
  Though, in this example, breaking a single <code>co_await</code> into its own function may
  seem silly, it is a technique that allows us to measure the overhead of composition of
  tasks. With proposed task, our per operation cost grew from 4ns to 6ns and 
  did not incur any heap allocations. Moreover, this overhead of 2ns is not 
  inherent to the task and we can anticipate that with improved coroutine
  optimization technologies we will be able to drive the overhead to be close to zero.
</p>
<p>To estimate the cost of composition with <code>std::future</code>, we used
  the following code:
  <pre>
      int fut_test() {
        int count = 1'000'000;
        int result = 0;
      
        while (count > 0) {
          promise<int> p;
          auto fut = p.get_future();
          p.set_value(count--);
          result += fut.get();
        }
        return result;
      }
  </pre>
  As measured on the same system (Linux, clang 6.0, libc++), we get <b>133ns</b> per operation!  
Here is the visual illustration.
<pre>
          op cost: ****
    task overhead: **
  future overhead: **********************************************************************************************************************************
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Being able to break apart bigger functions into a set of smaller ones and 
  being able to compose software by putting together small pieces is 
  fundamental requirement for a good software engineering since the 60s.
  The overhead of <code>std::future</code> and types similar in behavior 
  makes them unsuitable coroutine type.
</p>

<h2>Removing future overhead: Part 1. Memory Allocation</h2>

<!-- 
<p>A future and a promise share a reference to a heap allocated object that is
  used for communication from the promise to the future. Let's imagine what
  would it take to eliminate that heap allocation. We would need to 
  colocate the state either with a future or the promise objects. Since they 
  have independent lifetimes (and are movable), we would need a thread safe
  protocol to 
</p>
-->
<p>Consider the only operation that is available on a task, namely, awaiting on it.</p>
<pre>
  task&lt;X&gt; g();
  task&lt;Y&gt; f() { .... X x = co_await g(); ... }  
</pre>

<p>The caller coroutine <code>f</code> owns the task object for <code>g</code>
  that is created and destroyed at the end of the full expression containing
  co_await. This allows
  the compiler to determine the lifetime of the coroutine and apply
  Heap Allocation Elision Optimization [P0981R0] that eliminates 
  allocation of a coroutines state by making it a temporary variable
  in its caller.
</p>

<!--
The <code>task</code> object points directly at the coroutine state.
It does not require 
-->
<h2>Removing future overhead: Part 2. Reference counting</h2>

<p>The coroutine state is not shared. The task type only allows
  moving pointer to a coroutine from one task object to another.
  Lifetime of a coroutine is linked to its task object and
  task object destructors destroys the coroutine, thus, 
  no reference counting is required.
</p>
<p>
  In a later section about Cancellation we will cover the implications of this
  design decision.
</p>

<h2>Removing future overhead: Part 3. Set/Get synchronization</h2>
<p>The task coroutine always starts suspended. This allows not
  only to avoid synchronization when attaching a continuation, but 
  also enables solving via composition how and where
  coroutine needs to get executed and allows to implement advanced 
  execution strategies like continuation stealing.</p>

  <p>Consider this example:</p>

<pre>
  task&lt;int&gt; fib(int n) {
    if (n &lt; 2)
        return n;
    auto xx = co_await cilk_spawn(fib(n-1)); // continuation stealing
    auto yy = fib(n-2);
    auto [x,y] = co_await cilk_sync(xx,yy);
    co_return x + y;
  }        
</pre>

In here, <code>fib(n-1)</code> returns a task in a suspended state.
Awaiting on cilk_spawn adapter, queues the execution of the rest of the 
function to a threadpool, and then resumes <code>f(n-1)</code>.
Prior, this style of code was pioneered by Intel's cilk compiler and 
now, C++ coroutines and proposed <code>task</code> type allows to solve
the problem in a similar expressive style. (Note that we in no way
advocating computing fibonacci sequence in this way, however, this
seems to be a popular example demonstrating the benefits of 
continuation stealing and we are following the trend. 
Also we only sketched the abstraction required to implement
cilk like scheduling, there may be even prettier way).

<h2>Removing future overhead: Part 4. Scheduling overhead</h2>

<p>
  Consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    int result = 0;
    while (int v = co_await async_read())
      result += v;
</pre>
<p>
Let's say that async_read returns a future.
That future cannot resume directly the coroutine that 
is awaiting on it as it will, in effect, transform
the loop into unbounded recursion.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, coroutines have built-in support for
  symmetric coroutine to coroutine transfer [p0913r0]. Since
  task object can only be created by a coroutine and
  the only way to get the result from a coroutine is
  by awaiting on it from another coroutine, the transfer of
  control from completing coroutine to awaiting coroutine is
  done in symmetric fashion, thus eliminating the need for extra
  scheduling interactions.
</p>

<h2>Destruction and cancellation</h2>

<p>
Note that the <code>task</code> type unconditionally destroys 
the coroutine in its destructor. It is safe to do, only if the coroutine
has finished execution (at the final suspend point) 
or it is in a suspended state (waiting for some operation)
to complete, but, somehow, we know that the coroutine will never be 
resumed by the entity which was supposed to resume the coroutine
on behalf of the operation that coroutine is awaiting upon.
That is only possible if the underlying asynchronous facility support cancellation.
</p>

<p>
We strongly believe that support for cancellation is a required 
facility for writing asynchronous code and we struggled for awhile trying to
decide what is the source of the cancellation, whether it is the task, 
that must initiate cancellation (and therefore every await in every coroutine
needs to understand how to cancel a particular operation it is being awaited upon)
or every async operation is tied to a particular lifetime and cancellation domain
and operations are cancelled in bulk by cancellation of the entire cancellation domain 
[P0399R0].
</p>

<p>
We experimented with both approaches and reached the conclusion that 
not performing cancellation from the task, but, pushing it to the cancellation
domain leads to more efficient implementation and is a simpler model
 for the users.
</p>

<h2>Why can't I put a task into a container</h2>

<p>
This is rather unorthodox decision and even authors of the paper did not completely
agree on this topic. However, going with more restrictive model initially allows us to
discover if the insight that lead to this decision was wrong.
Initial design of the task, included move assignment, default constructor and swap.
We removed them for two reasons.
</p>
<p>First, when observing how <code>task</code> was used, we noticed
that whenever,
a variable-size container of tasks was created, we later realized that
it was a suboptimal choice and a better solution did not require
a container of tasks.
</p>
<p>Second: move-assignment of a task is a ticking bomb. To make it safe,
  we would need to introduce per task cancellation of associated 
  coroutines and it is a very heavy-weight solution.
</p>
<p>At the moment we do not offer a move assignment, default constructor and swap.
  If good use cases, for which there are no better ways to solve the same
  problem are discovered, we can add them.
</p>

<h2>Interaction with allocators</h2>

The implementation of coroutine bindings for <code>task</code> is required
to treat the case where first parameter to a coroutine is of type
<code>allocator_arg_t</code>. If that is the case, the coroutine needs to have
at least two arguments and the second one shall satisfy the Allocator requirements 
and if dynamic allocation required to store the coroutine state, 
implementation should use provided allocator to allocate and deallocate
the coroutine state.

Examples:

<pre>
  task&lt;int&gt; f(int, float); // uses default allocator if needed
  
  task&lt;int&gt; f(allocator_arg_t, pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt; a); // uses a to allocate, if needed
  
  template &lt;typename Alloc&gt;
  task&lt;int&gt; f(allocator_arg_t, Alloc a); // uses allocator a to allocate. if needed
</pre>

<h2>Interaction with executors</h2>

<p>Since coroutine starts suspended, it is upto the user to decide
  how it needs to get executed and where continuation needs to be scheduled.
</p>
<p>Case 1: Starts in the current thread, resumes in the thread that triggered the completion of f().</p>
<pre>
  co_await f();
</pre>

<p>Case 2: Starts in the current thread, resumes on executor ex.</p>
<pre>
  co_await f().via(e);
</pre>

<p>Case 3: Starts by an executor ex, resumes in the thread that triggered the completion of f().</p>
<pre>
  co_await spawn(ex, f());
</pre>

<p>Case 4: Starts by an executor ex1, resumes on executor ex2.
<pre>
  co_await spawn(ex1, f()).via(ex2);
</pre>
The last case is only needed if f() cannot start executing in the current thread
for some reason. We expect that this will not be a common case. Usually, 
when a coroutine has unusual requirements on where it needs to be executed it
can be encoded directly in f without forcing the callers of f, to do extra work.
Typically, in this manner:
<pre>
  task&lt;T&gt; f() {
    co_await make_sure_I_am_on_the_right_thread();
    ...
  }
</pre>
</p>

<!-- ******************************************* -->
<h2>But what about main?</h2>
<!-- ******************************************* -->
<p>
  As we mentioned in the beginning, the only operation that one can do on a task
  is to await on it (as if by `co_await` operator). Using an <em>await-expression</em>
  in a function turns it into a coroutine. But, this cannot go on forever,
  at some point, we have to interact with coroutine from a function that is not a 
  coroutine itself, <code>main</code>, for example. What to do?
</p>
<p>
  There could be several functions that can bridge the gap
  between synchronous and asynchronous world. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  template &lt;typename T&gt; T sync_await(task&lt;T&gt;);
</pre>
<p>
  This function starts the task execution in the current thread, and, 
  if it gets suspended, it blocks until the result is available. 
  To simplify the signature, we show <code>sync_await</code> only taking objects of <code>task</code>
  type. This function can be written generically to handle arbitrary awaitables.
</p>
<p> Another function could be a variant of <code>std::async</code> that
launches execution of a <code>task</code> on a thread pool and 
returns a <code>future</code> representing the result of the computation.
<pre>
  template &lt;typename T&gt; T async(task&lt;T&gt;);
</pre>
<!---
One would use std::async if they need to launch 
a task, do something else meanwhile without blocking the current thread
before requesting  -->

One would use this version of <code>std::async</code> 
if blocking behavior of <code>sync_await</code> is undesirable.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

A version of proposed type has been used in shipping software that runs on hundreds of
million devices in consumer hands. Also, a similar type has been implemented 
by one of the authors of this paper in most extensive coroutine abstraction
library (CppCoro). This proposed type is minimal and efficient and can be used
to build higher level abstraction by composition.
