<h1>P0668R3: Revising the C++ memory model</h1>
<p>
Although the current C++ memory model, adopted essentially in C++11, has served
our user community reasonably well in practice, a number of problems have come
to light. The first one of these is particularly new and troubling:
</p><ol>
<li>Existing implementation schemes on Power and ARM are not correct with
respect to the current memory model definition. These implementation schemes can
lead to results that are disallowed by the current memory model when the user
combines acquire/release ordering with seq_cst ordering. On some architectures,
especially Power and Nvidia GPUs, it is expensive to repair the implementations
to satisfy the existing memory model. Details are discussed in (Lahav et al) <a
href="http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf">http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf</a>
(which this discussion relies on heavily). The same issues
were briefly outlined at the Kona SG1 meeting. We summarize below.
<li>Our current definition of <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, especially for
fences, is too weak. This was caused by historical assumptions that
have since been disproved.
<li>The current definition of <i>release sequence</i> is problematic, allowing
seemingly irrelevant <code>memory_order_relaxed</code> operations to interfere
with synchronizes-with relationships.
<li>We still do not have an acceptable way to make our informal (since C++14)
prohibition of out-of-thin-air results precise. The primary practical effect of
that is that formal verification of C++ programs using relaxed atomics remains
unfeasible. The above paper suggests a solution similar to <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3710.html">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3710.html</a>
.  We continue to ignore the problem here, but try to stay out of the way of
such a solution.
<li>The current definition of <code>memory_order_consume</code> is widely
acknowledged to be unusable, and implementations generally treat it as
<code>memory_order_acquire</code>. The current draft "temporarily discourages"
it.
See <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0371r1.html">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0371r1.html</a>
. There are proposals to repair it (cf. <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0190r3.pdf">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0190r3.pdf</a> and
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0462r1.pdf">
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0462r1.pdf</a>
), but nothing that is ready to go.</li></ol>
<p>
Here we concentrate on, and outline proposals for, the first two.
The third one is now the subject of a separate proposal,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/wg21.link/p0982">P0982</a>, since it seemed to generate
more of an SG1 consensus than the others in Jacksonville.
The last two are not addressed here, but should be kept in mind.
In our view, the first of these is currently the most pressing.
</p>
<h3>Power, ARM, and GPU implementability</h3>
<p>
Although we previously believed otherwise, it has recently been shown that the
standard implementations of memory_order_acquire and memory_order_release on
Power are insufficient. Very briefly, these are compiled using "lightweight"
fences, which are insufficient to enforce required properties for
memory_order_sq_cst accesses to the same location.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate, we borrow the Z6.U example, from S 2.1 of <a
href="http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf">http://plv.mpi-sws.org/scfix/paper.pdf</a>
(pseudo-C++ syntax, memory orders indicated by subscript, e.g. y =<sub>rel</sub>
1 abbreviates <code>y.store(memory_order_release, 1)</code>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Thread 1</td> <td>Thread 2</td><td>Thread 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=2><code>x =<sub>sc</sub> 1</code><br>
<code>y =<sub>rel</sub> 1</code></td>

<td rowspan=2><code>b = fetch_add(y)<sub>sc</sub></code> //1<br>
<code>c = y<sub>rlx</sub></code> //3</td>

<td rowspan=2><code>y =<sub>sc</sub> 3</code><br>
<code>a = x<sub>sc</sub></code> //0</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
The comments here indicate the observed assigned value.
</p>
<p>
The indicated outcome here is disallowed by the current standard: All
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> (sc) accesses must occur in a single total
order, which is constrained to have <code><b>a = x<sub>sc</sub> //0</b></code>
before <code><b>x =<sub>sc</sub> 1</b></code> (since it doesn't observe the store),
which must be before <code><b>b = fetch_add(y)<sub>sc</sub> //1</b></code>
(since it happens before it), which must be before
<code><b>y =<sub>sc</sub> 3</b></code>
(since the fetch_add does not observe the store, which is
forced to be last in modification order by the load in Thread 2). But this is
disallowed since the standard requires the happens before ordering to be
consistent with the sequential consistency ordering,
and <code><b>y =<sub>sc</sub> 3</b></code>, the
last element of the sc order, happens before
<code><b>a = x<sub>sc</sub> //0</b></code>, the first one.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, this outcome is allowed by the Power implementation. Power
normally uses the "leading fence" convention for sequentially consistent
atomics. ( See <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/cpp0xmappings.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/cpp0xmappings.html</a>
) This means that there is only an lwsync fence between Thread 1's instructions.
This does not have the "cumulativity"/transitivity properties that would be
required to make the store to <code>x</code> visible to Thread 3 under
these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
This issue was missed in earlier analyses. This example is not a problem for the
"trailing fence" mapping that could also have been used on Power. But Lahav et
al contains examples that fail for that mapping as well, for similar reasons.
</p>
<p>
This example relies crucially on the fact that a
<code>memory_order_release</code> operation synchronizes with a
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation on the same location. Code that
consistently accesses each location only with <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>,
or only with weaker ordering, is not affected, and works correctly.
</p>
<p>
Whether or not such code occurs in practice depends on coding style. One
reasonable coding style is to initially use only seq_cst operations, and then
selectively weaken those that are performance critical; it does result in such
cases. Even in such cases, it seems clear that the current compilation strategy
does not result in frequent failures; this problem was discovered through
careful theoretical analysis, not bug reports. It is unclear whether there is
any real code that can fail as a result of the current mapping; it would require
careful analysis of the use cases to determine whether the weaker ordering
provided by the hardware is in fact sufficient for these use cases.
</p>
<p>
For ARM, the situation is theoretically similar, but appears to be much less
severe in practice. On ARMv8, the usual compilation mode for loads and stores is
currently to compile acquire/release operations as seq_cst operations, so there
is currently no issue. On ARMv7, some compilation schemes for acquire/release
have the same issues as for Power, but the most common scheme seems to be to use
"dmb ish", which does not share this problem.
</p>
<p>
Nvidia GPUs have a memory model similar to Power, and share the same issues,
probably with larger cost differences. For
very large numbers of cores, it is natural to share store buffers between
threads, which may make stores visible to different threads in inconsistent
orders. This lack of "multi-copy atomicity" is also the core distinguishing
property of the Power and ARM memory models. We suspect that other GPUs are also
affected, but cannot say that definitively.
</p>
<p>
We are not aware of issues on other existing CPU architectures. Since it appears
more attractive to drop multi-copy atomicity with higher core counts, we expect
the same issue to recur with some future processor designs.
</p>
<h3>Alternative 1: "Just" fix the implementations</h3>
<p>
Repairing this on Power without changing the specification would prevent us from
generating the lighter weight "lwsync" fence instruction for a
<code>memory_order_release</code> operation (unless we either know it will never
synchronize with a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation, or we make
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations even more expensive), which would
have a significant performance impact on acquire/release synchronization. It
would also defeat a significant part, though not all, of the motivation for for
introducing <code>memory_order_acquire</code> and
<code>memory_order_release</code> to start with.
</p>
<p>
The cost on GPUs is likely to be higher.
</p>
<p>
Among people we informally surveyed, this was not a popular option. Many people
felt that we would be penalizing a subset of the available machine architectures
for an issue with little practical impact. The language would no longer be able
to express pure acquire-release synchronization, which many people feel is
essential.
</p>
<p>
We could regain acquire-release synchronization by adding a new "weak" atomic
type that does not support <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, and requires
explicit<code> memory_order</code> arguments. Again there was general concern
that this significantly increases the library API footprint for an issue without
much practical impact.
</p>
<h3>Alternative 2: Fix the standard</h3>
<p>
This is the approach taken by Lahav et al, and the one we pursue here.
</p>
<p>
The proposal in Lahav et al is mathematically elegant. Currently the standard
requires that the sequential consistency total order S is consistent with the
happens before relation. Essentially, if any two sc operations are ordered by
happens before, then they must be ordered the same way by S. In our example,
this requires x =<sub>sc</sub> 1 to be ordered before b =
fetch_add(y)<sub>sc</sub> //1 in spite of the fact that the hardware mapping
does not sufficiently enforce it. The core fix (S1fix in the paper) is to relax
the restriction that a happens before ordering implies ordering in S to only the
sequenced before case, or the case in which the happens before ordering between
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is produced by a chain
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> is sequenced before <em>x</em> happens before <em>y</em> is
sequenced before <em>b</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The downside of this is that "happens before" now has a rather strange meaning,
since sequentially consistent operations can appear to execute in an order
that's not consistent with it.
</p>
<p>
In the Z6.U example, <code><b>x =<sub>sc</sub> 1</b></code>
must no longer precede <code><b>b = fetch_add(y)<sub>sc</sub> //1</b></code> in the
sequential consistency order S, in spite of
the fact that the former "happens before" the latter. And in the questionable
execution that we now wish to allow, they indeed have the opposite order in S.
</p>
<p>
We propose to make this somewhat less confusing by suitably renaming the
relations in the standard as follows:
</p>
<p>
Currently the initialization rules, etc. use "strongly happens before" in
guaranteeing ordering. The current intent is to also use that to specify library
ordering, such as for mutexes. We propose to modify that definition to require
"sequenced before" ordering at both ends. This new improved "strongly happens
before" would be used in the same contexts as now, and would remain strong
enough to ensure that if <em>a</em> happens before <em>b</em>, and they both
participate in the sc ordering S, then <em>a</em> also precedes <em>b</em> in S.
"Strongly happens before" would continue to exclude any ordering via
memory_order_consume, since such ordering is much more restrictive, and must be
explicitly accommodated by the caller.
</p>
<p>
Thus we would propose to change 6.8.2.1p11 [intro.races, a.k.a. 1.10] roughly as
follows (this is an early attempt at wording, which is still under discussion):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An evaluation A <em><del>strongly</del> <ins>simply</ins> happens before</em>
an evaluation B if either</p>
<ul>
<li>
A is sequenced before B, or
<li>
A synchronizes with B, or
<li>
A simply happens before X and X simply happens before B.
</ul>
<p>
[ <em>Note: </em>In the absence of consume operations, the happens before and
<del>strongly</del> <ins>simply</ins> happens before relations are identical.
<del>Strongly</del> <ins>Simply</ins> happens
before essentially excludes consume operations. <ins>It is used only in the
definition of <em>strongly happens before below</em>.</ins> — <em>end note</em> ]
</p>
<p>
<ins>An evaluation A <em>strongly happens before</em> an evaluation D if,
either</ins>
</p>
<ul>
<li><ins>A is sequenced before D, or</ins>
<li><ins>A synchronizes with D, and both A and D are sequentially consistent atomic
operations (32.4 [atomics.order]), or</ins>
<li><ins>there are evaluations B and C such that A is sequenced before B, B simply
happens before C, and C is sequenced before D, or</ins>
<li><ins>there is an evaluation B such that A strongly happens before B, and B
strongly happens before D.</ins>
</ul>
<p>
<ins>[ <em>Note:</em> Informally, if A strongly happens before B, then A appears to
be evaluated before B in all contexts. -<em>-end note</em> ]</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We would then adjust 32.4p3 [atomics.order] correspondingly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There shall be a single total order S on all
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations,
consistent with the "<ins>strongly</ins> happens before" order, and
modification orders for all affected locations, such that each
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation B that
loads a value from an atomic object M
observes one of the following values: …
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and add a second note at the end of p3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>
[ <em>Note:</em> We do not require that S be consistent with "happens before" (6.8.2.1
[intro.races]). This allows more efficient implementation of
<code>memory_order_acquire</code> and <code>memory_order_release</code> on some
machine architectures. It may produce more surprising results when these are
mixed with <code>memory_order_seq_cst </code>accesses. -- <em>end note</em> ]
</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note for editor: If the following section is also adopted, we just need the note
added to the text below. The normative change above is also included in the text below.]

<h4>Terminology and teachability</h4>
<p>
There was a fair amount of discussion in Jacksonville about the number of
different "happens before" variants, whether we plain "happens before" is correctly
used for the most important variant, and whether this is all understandable.
While we share some of this concern, we believe that the choices presented above
represent the best possible option.
<p>
We are not touching the requirement that user code avoid data races.
In the absence of weakly ordered atomics, this simply requires that conflicting
operations not be executed concurrently. And programmers need not concern
themselves with any of the happens-before variants. (We've added a few additional
constructs, beyond weakly ordered atomics, that violate this. But so far
such visible violations have been limited to code that is clearly unreasonable
for other reasons.)
<p>
Once we throw weakly-ordered atomics into the mix, the major concern that
programmers should have is whether this relaxation introduces data races.
That means that conflicting operations must be ordered by happens-before.
That also remains unchanged. The plain happens-before relation is unchanged,
and continues to be the right one to use here.
<p>
The definition of plain happens-before became unpleasantly complicated with the
introduction of <code>memory_order_consume</code>. And it is not transitive,
which remains counterintuitive.
This proposal changes neither of those. And if the user refrains from
using <code>memory_order_consume</code> it can continue to be entirely ignored,
as before. Until we have a usable version of <code>memory_order_consume</code>,
I would expect teaching materials to ignore these issues, and pretend that
happens-befors is defined as our simply-happens-before relation, which is
clearly transitive. In the presence of <code>memory_order_consume</code>,
this problem is unavoidable, since consume can order two accesses without
also ordering the first with respect to an access that immediately follows the
second; happens-before cannot compose with sequenced-before, and thus
happens-before cannot be transitive.
<p>
Unfortunately, the plain happens-before relation is not the right one to
use for most library writers. It does not suffice for a library to promise that
a call A happens-before a call B, since the library user will generally
also need to conclude that if B is immediately followed by another call C,
then A also happens before C. And we want to make sure that happens-before
promises also translate into guarantees about the ordering of
sequentially-consistent operations. By default libraries should hide their
internal weaknesses, and ensure correct usablility in all contexts.
Thus they must ensure a <i>stronger</i> notion of happens-before that
guarantees proper composability in all contexts. That is the purpose of
strong-happens-before.
<p>
The fundamental role of strong-happens-before also is not changed by this proposal.
However its definition has changed, since the old definition would no longer
imply consistency with the SC ordering, and would thus allow surprising
results in a few esoteric cases.
<p>
The definition of strong-happens-before now effectively requires that
<ul>
	<li><code>memory_order_consume</code> is not used to establish
		happens-before, and</li>
	<li>Any use of synchronizes-with in establishing the ordering
		must either use SC operations at both ends, or preceded
		and followed by a sequence-based intra-thread ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This definition is made appreciably more complicated
by this proposal, but in a way that should not concern most library
writers either. The only case it newly precludes is the one in which
the second constraint is violated. Normally the
strongly-happens-before guarantee will be used to order the users code
before and after the calls, meaning that the requirement is implicitly
satisfied by the addition of user code. It only matters when
the library calls themselves are promised to participate in the SC ordering,
so that the library user will use the happens-before relation to infer
properties of the SC ordering. And even in that case, the implementation
is likely to use SC operations at both ends, again avoiding any issues.
We do not know of a way to simplify this while preserving correctness with
respect to current widespread implementation strategies.
<p>
Summarizing, we continue to have, as we did before:
<dl>
	<dt>(plain) happens-before</dt>
	<dd>The fundamental relation used to reason about data races</dd>
	<dt>strong happens before</dt>
	<dd>The ordering relation usually promised by libraries to ensure
	usability and composability in all contexts</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The simply-happens-before relation is an atifact of our definition. In the absence of
<ol>
	<li><code>memory_order_consume</code>, and</li>
	<li>mixed use of both acquire/release and seq_cst operations on the same location</li>
</ol>
<p>
all three definitions coincide.

<h2>Strengthen SC fences</h2>
<p>
The current <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence semantics
do not guarantee that a program with only
memory_order_relaxed accesses and <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fences
between each pair actually exhibits sequential consistency. This was, at one
point, intentional. The goal was to ensure that architectures like Itanium that
allow stores to become visible to different processors in different orders, and
do not provide fences to rectify this, could be supported. But it subsequently
became clear that Itanium, as a result of failing to provide strong ordering for
accesses to a single location) would need to use stronger primitives for
memory_order_relaxed anyway. All known SC fence implementations provide the
stronger semantics, and we should acknowledge that.
</p>
<p>
We propose to strengthen the <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence semantics
as suggested in Lahav et al. (Note edit conflict with last section, and the
resolution suggested there.)

Replace Section 32.4 [atomics.order] paragraphs 3-7 (the definition of SC
ordering) with:

<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>An atomic operation A on some atomic object M <i>is coherence-ordered before</i>
another atomic operation B on M if</ins>
<ol>
<li> <ins>B observes the modification A, or</ins>
<li> <ins>A precedes B in the modification order, or</ins>
<li> <ins>A and B are not the same atomic read-modify-write operation,
and there exists an atomic modification X of M such that A observes the value
written by X and X precedes B in modification order, or</ins>
<li> <ins>there exists X such that A is coherence-ordered before X and X is
coherence-ordered before B.</ins>
</ol>
<p>
<ins>There shall be a single total order S on all <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations,
consistent with the “strongly happens before” order, such that for every pair of atomic
operations A and B on an object M, where A is coherence ordered before B,</ins>
<ul>
<li><ins>if A and B are both <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operations,
then A precedes B in S; and</ins>

<li><ins>if A is a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation and B happens before a
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence Y, then A precedes Y in S; and</ins>

<li><ins>if a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence X happens before A and B is
a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> operation, then X precedes B in S; and</ins>

<li><ins>if a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence X happens before A and B happens
before a <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence Y, then X precedes Y in S.</ins>
</ul>
<p>
<ins>[ <em>Note:</em> This definition ensures that S is consistent with the modification order.
It also ensures that a memory_order_seq_cst read of an atomic object M gets
its value either from the last modification of M that precedes A in S or from
some non-memory_order_seq_cst modification of M that does not happen before
any modification of M that precedes A in S. -- <em>end note</em> ]</ins>
</blockquote>
<p>
The note from the previous section would go after this.
<p>
The definition of "coherence-ordered before" is essentially standard terminology,
but was not previously part of our standard. The third
bullet corresponds to what's often called "reads before": A reads a write earlier than B.
<p>
This new wording takes a significantly different approach with respect to the
sequential consistency ordering S:
Instead of defining visibility in terms of S and the other orders in the standard,
this essentially defines constraints on S in terms of visibility in a particular
execution, as expressed by the coherence order. If these constraints are not satisfiable
by any total order S, then the candidate execution which gave rise to the coherence
order is not valid.

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>P0668R3</h3>
<p>
In response to SG1 discussion in Jacksonville:
<ul>
<li> Separated out the release sequence modifications into a separate paper,
<a href="http://wg21.link/P0982">P0982</a>.
<li> Added a section to justify the naming of happens-before variants
and explain the intended model for teaching.
SG1 was concerned that this would be hard to explain to a wider audience.
This concern was also previously raised in discussions among the authors.
</ul> 
<p>
The first clause in the definition of "coherence ordered before"
was stated backwards. Fixed.

<h3>P0668R2</h3>
<p>
Added wording for weakening release sequence guarantee. Adjust section numbering
to N4713.

<h3>P0668R1</h3>
<p>
In Toronto, we discussed an update D0668R1 of P0668R0 that added wording for the
sequentially consistent fence changes, and that added the release sequence proposal.
The first two proposals received strong support for the core idea; it was understood
that the precise wording needed more bake time.
<p>
The vote on the release sequence
proposal was delayed after hardware architects pointed out that it potentially
imposed significant hardware constraints. It made sense to reexamine the
significance of the underlying problem to make sure that the change was justified,
particularly since the entire argument for allowing same thread stores to extend a
release sequence now seems suspect.
<p>
This version incorporates the changes from the draft document we discussed,
fixes some serious editing mistakes in D0668R1, adds further discussion
for the release sequence proposal, and adjusts the desired straw poll list.

<h3>P0668R0</h3>
<p>
Initial version.

<h2>Desired straw polls</h2>
<ol>
<li>Advance the PowerPC/GPU-inspired changes to LEWG?
<li>Advance the seq_cst fence changes to LEWG?
<li>Should we weaken release sequences along the above lines of option 2 above,
deprecating the use of same-thread stores in release sequences?
<li>Should we strengthen release sequences along the lines of option 3 above?
