<h1>P0735R0: Interaction of <code>memory_order_consume</code> with release sequences</h1>
<p>
The current definition of <code>memory_order_consume</code> is not sufficient
to allow implementations to map a consume load to a "plain" load instruction
(i.e. without using fences), despite this being the intention of the original
proposal. Instead, <code>memory_order_consume</code> is typically treated as
though the program had specified <code>memory_order_acquire</code>, which is
now preferred by the standard (32.4p1.3 [atomics.order], <a
href="http://wg21.link/p0371">P0371</a>).
</p>
<p>
Work is ongoing to make <code>memory_order_consume</code> viable for
implementations (<a href="http://wg21.link/p0462">P0462</a>, <a
href="http://wg21.link/p0190">P0190</a>), but its interaction with release
sequences remains unchanged and continues to be problematic for ARMv8 and
potentially future architectures.
</p>

<h2>Release sequences</h2>
<p>
Release sequences provide a way to extend order from a release operation to
other stores to the same object that are adjacent in the modification order.
Consequently, an acquire operation can establish a "synchronizes with" relation
with a release store by reading from any member of the release sequence headed
by that store (32.4p2 [atomics.order]). An example use-case for release
sequences is when a locking implementation places other flags into the lock
word, which can be modified using relaxed read-modify-write operations by
threads that do not hold the lock. Without the ordering guarantees of the
release sequence, the read-modify-write operations updating the flags would
need to use <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code> to ensure that lock operations
synchronize with prior unlock operations for a given lock.
</p>
<p>
Consume operations interact with release sequences in a similar manner to
acquire operations via the "dependency-ordered before" relation (4.7.1p8
[intro.races]). One notable difference between the behaviour of consume and
acquire operations in this regard is that the consume operation must be
performed by a different thread than the one performing the release operation.
</p>
<p>
The following example shows a release store that is dependency-ordered before a
relaxed load, due to the release sequence from B to C:
</p>
<pre><code>
	int x, y;
	atomic&ltint *&gt datap;
	
	void p0(void)
	{
		x = 42; /* A */
		datap.store(&y, memory_order_release); /* B */
	}
	
	void p1(void)
	{
		int *p, *q, r;
	
		do {
			p = datap.exchange(&x, memory_order_relaxed); /* C */
		} while (p != &y);
	
		q = datap.load(memory_order_consume); /* D */
		r = *q; /* E */
	}
</code></pre>
<p>
The C++ memory model establishes the following relations, which can be used to
construct "happens before" for the program.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A is sequenced-before B
<ul>
	<li>
	therefore A happens before B
</ul>
<li>
C is in the release sequence headed by B
<li>
D reads from C
<ul>
	<li>
	therefore B is dependency-ordered before D
</ul>
<li>
D carries a dependency to E
<ul>
	<li>
	therefore B is dependency-ordered before E,
	<li>
	B inter-thread happens before E, and
	<li>
	B happens before E
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The "happens before" relation requires that <code>r == 42</code>, however this
is not guaranteed by the ARMv8 architecture if the existing compiler mappings
are changed to map <code>memory_order_consume</code> loads to <code>LDR</code>
(the same as <code>memory_order_relaxed</code>). There is production silicon
capable of exhibiting this behaviour.
</p>

<h2>Behaviour on hardware</h2>
<p>
In the previous example, P1 can be compiled to the following AArch64
instructions:
</p>
<pre><code>
/*
 * X0 = &x
 * X1 = &y
 * X2 = &datap
 * X3 = p
 * X4 = q
 * W5 = r
 */
.L1:	SWP	X3, X0, [X2]	// exchange
	CMP	X3, X1
	B.NE	.L1
	LDR	X4, [X2]	// consume load
	LDR	W5, [X4]	// dependent load
</code></pre>
<p>
In the absence of any fence instructions, the CPU can forward the write to
<code>datap</code> from the <code>SWP</code> instruction to the
<code>LDR</code> of the consume load, speculating past the conditional branch.
The dependent load can then complete before the <code>SWP</code> has returned
data, returning a stale value for <code>x</code> (i.e. not 42).
</p>
<p>
This behaviour is permitted by the ARMv8 memory model and is likely to be
permitted on other upcoming architectures.
</p>

<h2>Possible solutions</h2>
<p>
While it is tempting to fix this problem by changing "dependency-ordered
before" to require that the consume load must read a data value written by
another thread, this does not resolve the problem for non-multi-copy atomic
architectures that can perform forwarding between threads using a shared
pre-cache store buffer.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to restrict the read-modify-write operations that can appear
in a release sequence used to establish a "dependency-ordered before" relation
to those with implicit data dependencies (e.g.  <code>atomic_fetch_*</code>).
This would notably omit <code>compare_exchange</code> operations which only
provide a control dependency and are not sufficent to order against subsequent
loads. Since <code>compare_exchange</code> is often used to implement
<code>atomic_fetch_*</code> operations, then ordering may be broken in certain
corner-cases (e.g. saturating arithmetic).
</p>
<p>
Given that there appear to be no known use-cases for release sequences in
conjunction with <code>memory_order_consume</code> operations, this paper
instead proposes to remove then entirely from the definition of
"dependency-ordered before".
</p>

<h2>Proposed wording</h2>
<p>
Change 4.7.1p8 [intro.races] to remove release sequences from the definition of
"dependency-ordered before":
</p>
<blockquote>
An evaluation A is dependency-ordered before an evaluation B if
<ul>
<li>
A performs a release operation on an atomic object M, and, in another thread, B
performs a consume operation on M and reads <del>a value written by any
side effect in the release sequence headed</del> <ins>the value written</ins>
by A, or
<li>
for some evaluation X, A is dependency-ordered before X and X carries a
dependency to B.
</ul>
[ <em>Note:</em> The relation "is dependency-ordered before" is analogous to
"synchronizes with", but uses release/consume in place of release/acquire. â€”
<em>end note</em> ]
</blockquote>
