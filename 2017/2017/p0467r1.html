<h2><a name="1.0">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The C++17 CD,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4604">N4604</a>,
provides additional overloads for most of the algorithms in the <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt>
and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> headers, generally by repeating the declaration of the
non-parallel form with a leading parallel-policy parameter.  It is not clear that
sufficient thought was given to the iterator category when providing such additions,
and this paper looks into some of the resulting issues.  As there are several reasonable
directions to proceed from here, formal wording will not be provided until the first
revision of this paper, following LEWG review.
</p>

<h2><a name="2.0">2. Problems to be addressed</a></h2>
<p>
The main problem is that the parallel algorithms are underspecified.  This paper
claims that the poor specification naturally leads to those same algorithms
being under-constrained, and suggests that different constraints may be
appropriate for the serial and parallel forms of the same algorithm.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1 The Standard Algorithms Are Underspecified</a></h3>
<p>
To start, we must realize that many of the existing standard algorithms are
under-constrained, at least when we want to extend their specification to
cover the otherwise-unspecified parallel case.
</p>

<p>
Good examples of algorithms that have had their specification honed over
several standard revisions are <tt>adjecent_difference</tt> and
<tt>partial_sum</tt> in the <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> header.  However, most
algorithms are more like <tt>copy</tt>, and have poorly stated requirements
that must be implicitly reverse-engineered from their <i>Effects:</i> clause.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.2">2.2 Input Iterators Invalidate Too Frequently</a></h3>
<p>
The basic problem with an Input Iterator is that it does not provide the
multi-pass guarantee.  This makes it impossible for a parallel algorithm to
work with different subsequences at the same time, as it is not possible to
advance the iterator to refer to such subsequences without invalidating the
iterators used by other threads.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.3">2.3 Copying an Input Range Requires Memory, and Copy Semantics</a></h3>
<p>
One workaround for the lack of a multi-pass guarantee is to make copies of
subsets of the input range, and dispatch work on those subsets.  If this is
the intended semantic, which is the understanding of the author, then it would
be helpful to call this out in the parallel algorithms wording at the front of
clause 25, so that future discussion in the Library Working Group dealing with
parallel algorithms is informed of a deliberate design decision, calling out
the runtime trade-offs and overheads accepted for the parallel forms.  However,
permission to create copies is not sufficient, as the algorithms do not
currently require those elements to be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.  For example,
it is expected that the <tt>move</tt> algorithm work with <tt>move_iterator</tt>s,
possibly over sequences of <tt>unique_ptr</tt>s.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.4">2.4 Writing to an Output Iterator Implies a Serialization Stage</a></h3>
<p>
Algorithms that write to Output Iterators do not currently require
<tt>CopyConstrutible</tt> elements; for example, an <tt>ostream_iterator</tt>
requires just a reference in order to write the result to a stream.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following example:
</p>
<pre>
template &lt;typename T&gt;
void WriteVector(std::vector&lt;T&gt; const & v, std::ostream & os)  {
   copy(v.begin(), v.end(), std::ostream_iterator(os, ", "));
}
</pre>

<p>
Despite the name of the algorithm being <tt>copy</tt>, we do not expect
to make any actual copies executing with these iterators.  For a clearer
example, consider the following:
</p>

<pre>
template &lt;typename T&gt;
void WriteVector(std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; const & v, std::ostream & os)  {
   std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(),
                  std::ostream_iterator(os, ", "),
                  [](auto const &ptr){ return ptr.get(); });
}
</pre>
<p>
In this case, we cannot copy elements from the source range, as
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> does not have a usable copy constructor, but there is
still an expectation that the algorithm should compile and run.
</p>

<p>
An output sequence supplied through a simple output iterator, such as the
aforementioned <tt>ostream_iterator</tt>, does not offer the multi-pass
guarantee; so again, output must be collected and output serially.  It would
be very surprising for the <tt>copy</tt> algorithms to write a permuted
sequence, or for <tt>merge</tt> to produce a non-sorted output.
</p>


<h2><a name="3.0">3. Proposed Resolution: Promote All Iterators to At Least Forward Iterators</a></h2>
<p>
The simplest short-term fix is to require that no iterator for a parallel
algorithm has a category less capable than a Forward Iterator.  This change
guarantees that all iterators in parallel algorithms return a true reference,
i.e., no copies are ever required, and the multi-pass guarantee allows the
implementation to <tt>advance</tt> the destination (output) iterators without
requiring additional storage to queue results for serialization.
</p>

<p>
This solution is recommended as it preserves the ability to weaken the constraints
on iterators in a future library, once the implementation requirements are clear.
It also grants time to the Library Working Group to properly document the constraints
on the existing non-parallel algorithms.
</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Which Algorithms Are Affected?</a></h3>
<p>
Roughly 40 parallel algorithms use either input or output iterators in their
interface, most of which use both.
</p>

<h4>Parallel Algorithms with Input Iterators and an Implicit Specification</h4>
<p>
The following algorithms all consume input ranges, may write to a simple output
iterator, and make no clear requirement that the element type be copyable.
Their specification is entirely implicit, not appearing beyond their corresponding
header synopsis.
</p>
<pre>
	all_of
	any_of
	none_of
	find
	find_if
	find_if_not
	find_first_of
	count
	count_if
	mismatch
	equal
	copy_n
	copy_if
	transform
	replace_copy
	replace_copy_if
	remove_copy
	remove_copy_if
	partial_sort_copy
	merge
	includes
	set_union
	set_intersection
	set_difference
	set_symmetric_difference
	lexicographical_compare
	reduce
	transform_reduce
	inner_product
	exclusive_scan
	inclusive_scan
	transform_exclusive_scan
	transform_inclusive_scan
</pre>

<h4>Parallel Algorithms with Input Iterators and an Explicit Specification</h4>
<p>
The following algorithms all consume input ranges, may write to a simple output
iterator, and do not make a clear requirement that the element type be copyable.
They do provide a distinct specification for the parallel form having a subtly
different interface, such as<tt>for_each</tt>, or slightly different requirements,
such as <tt>copy</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
	for_each
	for_each_n
	copy
	move
</pre>

<h4>Parallel Algorithms Writing Through Output Iterators</h4>
<p>
The following algorithms not already mentioned as consuming an input sequence
require a serial (potentially copying) stage to write through an output iterator.
</p>
<pre>
	fill_n
	generate_n
	reverse_copy
	rotate_copy
</pre>

<h4>Potentially Well-specified Algorithms</h4>
<p>
The following algorithms over input ranges have implicitly specified parallel
overloads, but may have a strong enough serial specification that the requirements
are sufficient to allow for some parallel execution.  However, even in these cases,
careful review will likely suggest a minimal tweaking for clear support.
<pre>
	unique_copy
	partition_copy
	partial_sum
	adjacent_difference
</pre>

<h2><a name="4.0">4. Alternatives Solutions</a></h2>
<p>
Several other resolutions were considered preparing this paper, and should be
considered alongside the recommended resolution above.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Do Nothing</a></h3>
<p>
There is an intent that it should be very simple to turn serial C++ code into
parallel code by simply adding a parallel-policy argument to the call of an
algorithm.  This becomes more troublesome if the user has to consider the
potential for different requirements on the serial and parallel forms.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the standard gives no mandate that even those algorithms called
with iterators that reveal embarrassing potential for parallelism should actually
distribute the work, not least because the standard does not exclude environments
that support only a single thread of execution.  From this perspective, the
parallel execution policies are no more than a hint to the library, like the
<tt>inline</tt> keyword is a hint to the compiler.  They allow for the relaxation
of certain constraints (such as the ODR in the case of <tt>inline</tt>), subject to
further constraints (e.g., identical definitions) that will retain proper behavior.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the promise made, beyond being a hint to the library that concurrent
execution is desired, is the guarantee that passed function objects and iterators
do not introduce data races when executed on different (unsynchronized) threads.
This guarantee is a constraint on the user of the algorithm, rather than on the
library implementation.
</p>

<p>
The author rejects this direction, as making a false offer of parallelism
where serial implementations are effectively mandated is even more misleading.
It would be better for the caller to confront the issues with their data
structures that inhibit effective parallelism.  Also, to some extent this risk
is already assumed in the several algorithms that already have a different
interface or contract for the serial and parallel forms, such as <tt>for_each</tt>
and <tt>copy</tt>.
</p>
<p>
A further concern with this approach is that it has not been applied consistently
through the library, as there are several algorithms with no parallel overloads,
which could easily be given parallel overloads on the assumption that all known
implementations would be sequential, but open to QoI enhancement in the future.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.1a">4.1a Add the Missing Parallel Overloads</a></h3>
<p>
This is an extension of the <i>do nothing</i> solution, which addresses the
concern that the abstraction of parallel policy as a hint does not work as
long as there are some algorithms lacking the parallel policy overloads.
Therefore, the policy parameter would be added to the remaining algorithms
called out as <i>not</i> supported in the Parallelism Extensions TS.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Revise Requirements on all Algorithms</a></h3>
<p>
This resolution would likely require more effort from the Library Working Group
than is available within the ballot resolution period for C++17.  It would
involve first correctly specifying all of the existing serial algorithms with a
level of detail that is missing today.  Once those specifications are complete,
the parallel form of those same algorithms can be reviewed, and specified with
additional constraints where necessary, such as the ability to take copies in
order to create sub-tasks.
</p>
<p>
This resolution is the preferred long-term goal of the paper author, but seems
beyond the scope of what can be achieved in two standard meetings, while
addressing all of the other outstanding ballot comments.  One possible result
of this approach might be weaker requirements and a mandate to avoid undue
serialization in the event of algorithms being called with Forward Iterators
(or better) rather than simple Input or Output Iterators.  At the least, it is
an opportunity for the standard to acknowledge the greater capabilities that
would come from such iterators.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 Blanket Wording Permitting Copies in Parallel Algorithms</a></h3>
<p>
A half-way house would be to add additional blanket wording to the parallel
algorithms front-matter, that says that any algorithm with a parallel policy
overload taking input or output iterators as parameters, requires that the
element type for such iterators be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
</p>

<p>
While this direction would the progress from the status-quo, it suffers from
still being an awkward specification for readers of the standard, who must be
aware that there are now requirements on algorithms documented in several other
places than the algorithm itself is specified, especially for parallel forms
that are not otherwise specified at all.  This could be partially alleviated
by applying a blanket edit to actually specify those algorithms below the
serial form, adding the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> constraints in each case.
Such a solution would still suffer from interactions with the under-specification
of the serial forms though.
</p>
<p>
A trickier problem is that Output Iterators do not actually have an element
type, so it is not clear what <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> constraint should
apply to.
</p>

<h2><a name="5.0">5. Implementation Experience</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0024r1">P0024r1</a>
provide links to existing practice prior to standardization.  How do these
implementations handle the problems highlighted in this paper?
</p>

<h3><a name="5.1">5.1 Force Serial Execution</a></h3>
<p>
The Microsoft implementation at CodePlex simply forces all calls with input
iterators into the sequential policy overloads - I did not find special handling
for output iterators, but could easily have missed it in the time I had for this
review.
</p>

<h3><a name="5.2">5.2 Copy Elements into Subranges</a></h3>
<p>
The Khronos Sycl Parallel STL appears to try to copy elements into subranges,
and performs parallel execution with the sub-ranges.  The additional requirements
for copyable elements do not appear to be documented, and as far as I can tell,
calling with an incompatible element type would lead to a failure instantiating
the template, deep in the implementation details.  Libraries using this approach
are best place to provide insights into the missing requirements, if that is the
preferred direction.
</p>

<h3><a name="5.3">5.3 Ignore the Issue (bug?)</a></h3>
<p>
Other libraries seemed to simply ignore the issue, working with potentially
invalidated input (or output) iterators and risking undefined behavior.  i.e.,
they have bugs, and lend no insight for a likely solution.
</p>
<p>
I am not calling out which of the unreferenced libraries fall into the categories
above, as I did not have time for a detailed review, but these three categories
appear to cover the range of the behavior I encountered.
</p>
