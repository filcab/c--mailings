paragraph 1,</P>

<P>However, the rewritten expansion of the range-based <TT>for</TT>

this general rule, so that the index variable is not visible in the

Use of class type being defined in <I>trailing-return-type</I>

<P>According to _N4567_.5.1.1 [expr.prim.general] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Unlike the object expression in other
contexts, <TT>*this</TT> is not required to be of complete
type for purposes of class member access
(8.2.5 [expr.ref]) outside the member function
body.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Is this special treatment of member access expressions intended
to apply only to <TT>*this</TT>, or does it apply to other ways of
specifying the class being defined in the object expression?  For
example,</P>

<PRE>
  struct S {
    int i;
    auto f1() -&gt; decltype((*this).i);      //<SPAN style="font-family:Times;font-style:italic"> okay</SPAN>

    auto f3() -&gt; decltype(((S*)0)-&gt;i);     //<SPAN style="font-family:Times;font-style:italic"> okay?</SPAN>
  };
</PRE>

<P>There is implementation divergence on this question.</P>

<P>If the intent is to allow object expressions other than
<TT>*this</TT> to have the current class type, this specification
should be moved from _N4567_.5.1.1 [expr.prim.general] to
8.2.5 [expr.ref] paragraph 2, which is where the general
requirement for complete object expression types is found.</P>

passage is not quite correct:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[<I>Note:</I> only class members declared prior to the
declaration are visible. &#8212;<I>end note</I>]

<P>This does not apply when the member is a &#8220;member of an
unknown specialization,&#8221; per 17.6.2.1 [temp.dep.type]
paragraph 5 bullet 3 sub-bullet 1; for example,</P>

For the purpose of <SPAN style="font-weight:bold;background-color:#A0FFA0">forming a set of candidates during</SPAN>
overload resolution, the functions that are introduced by
a <I>using-declaration</I> into a derived class are treated as
though they were members of the derived class. In particular, the
implicit <TT>this</TT> parameter shall be treated as if it were a
pointer to the derived class rather than to the base class. This
has no effect on the type of the function, and in all other
respects the function remains a member of the base
class. Likewise, constructors that are introduced by
a <I>using-declaration</I> are treated as though they were
constructors of the derived class when looking up the
constructors of the derived class (6.4.3.1 [class.qual])
or forming a set of overload candidates
(16.3.1.3 [over.match.ctor], 16.3.1.4 [over.match.copy],
