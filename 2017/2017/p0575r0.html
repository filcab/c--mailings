Empty aggregate initializer for union

<P>According to 8.6.1 [dcl.init.aggr] paragraph 15,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a union is initialized with a brace-enclosed initializer, the braces
shall only contain an <I>initializer-clause</I> for the first non-static
data member of the union.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This would appear to preclude using <TT>{}</TT> as the initializer for a
union, which would otherwise have reasonable semantics.  Is there a reason
for this restriction?</P>

<P>Also, paragraph 7 reads,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If there are fewer <I>initializer-clause</I>s in the list than there are
members in the aggregate, then each member not explicitly initialized shall
be initialized from an empty initializer list (8.6.4 [dcl.init.list]).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There should presumably be special treatment for unions, so that only
a single member is initialized in such cases.</P>

<P>(See also issue 1460.)</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2016):</B></P>

<P>The resolution of issue 1489 added wording

2 in an attempt to clarify the status of an example like</P>

<PRE>
  int a[1000]{};

<P>However, this example is aggregate initialization, not value
initialization.  Also, now that we allow <I>brace-or-equal-initializer</I>s
in aggregates, this wording also needs to be updated to allow an aggregate
with constant non-static data member initializers to qualify for constant
initialization.</P>

Unclear rules for friend definitions in templates
</H4><B>Section: </B>14.5.4&#160; [temp.friend]

 <B>Status: </B>ready

 <B>Date: </B>2015-09-17




<P>According to 14.5.4 [temp.friend] paragraph 4,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When a function is defined in a friend function declaration
in a class template, the function is instantiated when the
function is odr-used (3.2 [basic.def.odr]). The same
restrictions on multiple declarations and definitions that
apply to non-template function declarations and definitions
also apply to these implicit definitions.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This seems to imply that:</P>

<OL><LI><P>Instantiating a class template that contains a friend
function definition instantiates the declaration, but not
the definition, of that friend function, as usual (but see
below).</P></LI>

<LI>

<P>If the function is odr-used, a definition is instantiated
for each such class template specialization whose template
had a definition.</P></LI>

<LI>

<P>If that results in multiple definitions, the program is
ill-formed as usual.</P></LI>

</OL>

<P>The intent appears to be that the instantiated friend
function declarations should be treated as if they were
definitions, but that's not clear from the wording.  This
wording is also missing similar provisions for friend
function template definitions; there is implementation
divergence on the treatment of such cases.</P>

<P>There also does not appear to be wording that says that
instantiating a class template specialization results in
the instantiation of friend functions declared/defined
therein (the relevant wording was removed from this section
by issue 329). Presumably this
should be covered in 14.7.1 [temp.inst] paragraph 1,
which also includes the following wording that could be
reused for the <TT>friend</TT> case:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

However, for the purpose of determining whether an
instantiated redeclaration of a member is valid according to
9.2 [class.mem], a declaration that corresponds to
a definition in the template is considered to be a
definition.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Also, the reliance on odr-use to trigger friend instantiation
is out of date, as there are other contexts that can require
an instantiation when there is no odr-use (a <TT>constexpr</TT>
function invoked within an unevaluated operand).</P>

<P>According to 7.6.1 [dcl.attr.grammar] paragraph 5, a program is
ill-formed if an <I>attribute</I> appertains to an entity or statement to
which it is not allowed to apply. Presumably an <I>alignment-specifier</I>
should have the same restriction.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2016):</B></P>

<P>Change 7.6.1 [dcl.attr.grammar] paragraph 5 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Each <I>attribute-specifier-seq</I> is said to <I>appertain</I> to some
entity or statement, identified by the syntactic context where it appears
(Clause 6 [stmt.stmt], Clause 7 [dcl.dcl], Clause
8 [dcl.decl]). If an <I>attribute-specifier-seq</I> that
appertains to some entity or statement contains an <I>attribute</I>
<SPAN style="font-weight:bold;background-color:#A0FFA0">or <I>alignment-specifier</I></SPAN> that is not allowed to apply to
that entity or statement, the program is ill-formed. If
an <I>attribute-specifier-seq</I> appertains to a friend declaration
(11.3 [class.friend]), that declaration shall be a
definition. No <I>attribute-specifier-seq</I> shall appertain to an
explicit instantiation (14.7.2 [temp.explicit]).

Ambiguity and namespace aliases

<P>There is implementation divergence on the status of the following
example:</P>

<PRE>
  namespace A { namespace B { int x; } }
  namespace C { namespace B = A::B; }
  using namespace A;
  using namespace C;
  int x = B::x;
</PRE>

<P>This should presumably be valid: the lookup of <TT>B</TT> finds
<TT>A::B</TT> and <TT>C::B</TT>, but it is not ambiguous because they
denote the same entity. A similar example with a <I>using-declaration</I>
or <I>alias-declaration</I> seems to be universally accepted. Perhaps
the lookup rules need to be clarified regarding the status of this
example.</P>

<P><B>Proposed resolution (November, 2016):</B></P>

<P>Change 3.4 [basic.lookup] paragraph 1 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The name lookup rules apply uniformly to all names
(including <I>typedef-name</I>s
(7.1.3 [dcl.typedef]), <I>namespace-name</I>s
(7.3 [basic.namespace]), and <I>class-name</I>s
(9.1 [class.name])) wherever the grammar allows such names in the
context discussed by a particular rule.  Name lookup associates the use of
a name with a <SPAN style="text-decoration:line-through;background-color:#FFA0A0">declaration</SPAN> <SPAN style="font-weight:bold;background-color:#A0FFA0">set of declarations</SPAN>
(3.1 [basic.def]) of that name. <SPAN style="text-decoration:line-through;background-color:#FFA0A0">Name lookup shall find an
unambiguous declaration for the name (see 10.2 [class.member.lookup]). Name
lookup may associate more than one declaration with a name if it finds the
name to be a function name;</SPAN> <SPAN style="font-weight:bold;background-color:#A0FFA0">The declarations found by name
lookup shall either all declare the same entity or shall all declare
functions; in the latter case,</SPAN> the declarations are said to form a
set of overloaded functions (13.1 [over.load]). Overload
resolution...
