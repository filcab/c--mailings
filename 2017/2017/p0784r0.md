# Standard containers and constexpr

### Introduction and motivation

Variable size container types, like `std::vector` or `std::unordered_map`, are generally useful for runtime programming, and therefore also potentially useful in constexpr computations. This has been made clear by some recent experiments such as the [Constexpr ALL the things!](https://youtu.be/HMB9oXFobJc) presentation (and its companion paper [P0810R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0810r0.pdf) to be published in the pre-Albuquerque mailing) by Ben Deane and Jason Turner, in which they build a compile-time JSON parser and JSON value representation using `constexpr`. Amongst other things, the lack of variable size containers forces them to use primitive fixed-size data structures in the implementation, and to parse the input JSON string twice; once to determine the size of the data structures, and once to parse the JSON into those structures.

We also expect variable size containers to be a necessity in the reflection and metaprogramming APIs that will emerge from the work in SG-7, which decided that the preferred direction for a standard solution would involve constexpr-like computation. For example, querying the template arguments of a class type might look something like:

```c++
std::vector<std::metainfo> args = std::meta::get_template_args(reflexpr(T));
```

There are three aspects of `std::vector` that make it currently unusable in constexpr evaluations:

1. Destructors cannot be constexpr.
2. Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation isn't available.
3. In-place construction using placement-new isn't available.

### Destructors

The limitation that destructors cannot be constexpr is somewhat artificial: We can just lift the restriction. We have discussed the issues with the implementers of MSVC++ (Microsoft), GCC, Clang, and EDG's front end, and they all agreed that it would entail at most a minor cost in the performance of constexpr evaluations.

The proposed rules for constexpr destructors are:

* Destructors can be declared constexpr.
* Defaulted destructors are implicitly constexpr if their implementation does not call non-constexpr destructors.
* As an important special case, trivial destructors are implicitly constexpr.
* A literal type requires a constexpr destructor (previously, the stronger requirement of a trivial destructor was made).
* An object that has been destroyed (and not reconstructed --- see later) cannot be accessed during constexpr evaluation, even if its destructor is trivial.

For a constexpr variable to be declared, we would extend the
requirement that the variable has a constant initializer with 
a second requirement that the variable has *constant 
destruction*. This means that the evaluation of the 
variable's destructor on the constant value produced by the 
initializer must also be a constant expression.


### Memory allocation

The memory implementation of the constexpr evaluator is unlike that of typical normal (run-time) program evaluation.Â  For example, it *must* be able to catch any form of undefined behavior. That means that the representation of a pointer or reference cannot just be an address: Additional metadata is needed to be able to relate the pointer to the bounds of the object it points into. Another example: Metadata is needed to know which field of a union is active.

Because of this, casting a raw memory pointer (say, a `void*`) into a pointer to an actual object is not generally viable. That removes the option of using something like

```c++
void* operator new(std::size_t);
```

during constexpr evaluation: There is no reasonable way to turn the `void*` back into a `T*`.

Instead we can contemplate two other options:

1. Deal in terms of (non-placement) new- and delete-expressions.
2. Deal in terms of the standard allocator.

Both of these provide *typed* storage that doesn't require further reinterpretation. We can therefore establish rules that make them work "magically" during constexpr evaluation (without evaluating the underlying raw storage pointer arithmetic or pointer reinterpretations).  We'll discuss those rules further on, but one guiding principle is that memory that is dynamically allocated during constexpr evaluation cannot just "escape" into the run time implementation.

### In-place construction

Standard containers rely on the ability to separate the allocation and construction of
objects through the `std::allocator_traits` interface. In particular,
`std::allocator_traits<A>::construct` is a typed API that just turns around and calls
a non-typed placement-new-expression ("non-typed" because the extra-parameter of the 
placement-new operator is `void*`).  Although we cannot make the general placement-new
mechanism work in constexpr evaluation, we *can* decree that:

```c++
new(ptr) T{...}
```
	
is a valid core constant expression if `ptr` is obtained by a standard conversion from
a `T*` pointer value that points to a "dead object":

* the storage of an object of type `T` that has been destroyed and not yet (in part or in whole)
  reconstructed, or
* type `T` storage that has been obtained from the default allocator and in which no object
  has yet been constructed.

Requiring that the storage being constructed into is "dead" makes for a clean semantic model.
However, for non-class types, pseudo-destructor calls don't currently end the lifetime of
the underlying object.  We are therefore left with three options:

* permit construction over a "live" object (preserving its complete type), or
* add general semantics to pseudo-destructor calls ending the lifetime of the underlying
  objects, or
* add semantics to pseudo-destructor calls ending the lifetime of the underlying
  objects during constexpr evaluation only.

For example:

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <new>

constexpr int f() {
  std::allocator<double> a;
  double *b = a.alloc(1);
  new (b) double{3.3};

  // Does constexpr evaluation fail because `b` already
  // points to a live object?
  new (b) double{4.4};

  a.deallocate(b, 1);
  return 0;
}

constexpr int evaluate_as_constexpr = f();
```

### Non-transient allocation

During a constexpr evaluation, any allocated storage that is
deallocated before the evaluation completes poses few 
problems: We call those constexpr allocations *transient*. 
We'll decree that the overall result of a constant expression 
cannot contain a pointer or reference to storage from a 
transient allocation. (Note that since C++14, a compiler is 
allowed to optimize away certain allocations and 
deallocations, and the *transient* constexpr allocation rules 
can be interpreted as mandating such elision for constexpr 
evaluations.)

What about storage that hasn't been deallocated by the time evaluation completes?  We could just disallow that, but there are really compelling use cases where this might be desirable. E.g., this could be the basis for a more flexible kind of "string literal" class.  We therefore propose that if a non-transient constexpr allocation is valid (to be described next), the allocated objects are promoted to static storage duration.  A constexpr evaluation of an expression *expr* can refer to a *non-transient* allocation if:

* *expr* is a full expression in a context that requires a constant expression, and
* the result of evaluating *expr* is an object with a nontrivial constexpr destructor, and
* evaluating that destructor would be a valid core constant expression and would deallocate all the *non-transient* allocations produced by the evaluation of *expr*.

For example:

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <new>
using namespace std;
template<typename T> struct S: allocator<T> {
  T *ps;
  int sz;
  template<int N> constexpr S(T (&p)[N])
                          : sz{N}
                          , ps{this->allocate(N)} {
    for (int k = 0; k<N; ++k) {
      new(this->ps+k) T{p[k]};
    }
  }
  constexpr ~S() {
    for (int k = 0; k<this->sz; ++k) {
      (this->ps+k)->T::~T();
    }
    this->deallocate(this->ps, this->sz);
  }
};

constexpr S<char> str("Hello!");
  // str ends up pointing to a static array
  // containing the string "Hello!".
```
      
The constructor constexpr evaluation in this example is successful, 
producing an `S` object that points to a non-transient constexpr allocation.
The constexpr evaluation of the destructor would also be successful and would
deallocate the non-transient allocation. The non-transient allocation is
therefore promoted to static storage.

### Object lifetime issues

The current rules regarding object storage reuse (in [basic.life]) for objects
that contain immutable data or objects that contain variant (i.e., union)
members are either subtle or in need of revision.  We think it is acceptable
for constexpr evaluation to put stronger constraints on this than the general
abstract machine, but the reverse is probably not acceptable.  For now, we
therefore propose to disallow placement new for types that contain const
subobjects, references, or union subobjects (including anonymous unions).  For example:

```c++
#include <new>
struct S {
  int const ic;
};
constexpr int f() {
  S s{41};
  s.~S();
  new (&s) S{42};  // Not a core constant expression.
  return s.ic;
}
constexpr int r = f();  // Error.
```

We're hopeful, however, that we will be able to lift that restriction when the
general object model has been cleaned up.

### Library pragmatism

Current implementations of standard libraries sometimes perform various
raw storage operations through interfaces other than the standard allocator
and allocator traits.  That may make it difficult to make the associated
components usable in constexpr components.  Based on a cursory examination
of current practices, we therefore propose to start only with the requirement
that the container templates in the [containers] clause be usable in
constexpr evaluation, when instantiated over literal types and the default
allocator.  In particular, this excludes `std::string`, `std::variant`,
and various other allocating components.  Again, it is our hope we will be
able to extend support to more components in the future.

With regards to the default allocator and allocator traits implementation,
the majority of the work is envisioned in the constexpr evaluator: It
will recognize those specific components and implement their members
directly (without necessarily regarding the library definition).  
We might, however, consider decorating the class members with the `constexpr`
keyword.
Also, some implementations provide extra members in these class templates
(such as libc++'s `allocator_traits<A>::__construct_forward`) that perform
non-constexpr-friendly operations (`memcpy`, in particular).  Lifting such
members to standard status would help interoperability between library
and compiler implementations.


### Implementation experience

So far, this has not been implemented. However, based on preliminary discussion
with implementers working on Clang, MSVC and EDG, no blockers that would make
this feature unimplementable or prohibitively expensive to implement have been
identified at the moment.
