## 2. PERIOD REVIEW

### 2.1. MARKET REQUIREMENTS

ISO C++ remains a widely-used foundation technology, well-received in the marketplace.

Although C++ has long been a consistently popular language, since 2011 in particular it has enjoyed a renewed cycle of growth and investment in tools and platform support across the industry. This was driven primarily by the C++11 standard's completion at the same time as the industry saw a resurgence of interest in performance-efficient, hardware-efficient, and especially power-efficient systems programming capability for mobile devices, cloud data centers, high-performance financial systems, vector and GPGPU computing (via nonstandard extensions to C++ that we are now investigating standardizing), and other major growth sectors and environments.

This new cycle of industry investment in C++ includes, but is not limited to, investment in:

1) tools, such as the advent of a new major C++ implementation in the Clang compiler and other major new products actively competing to fully implement the latest ISO C++ standard;

2) organization, with the establishment of the Standard C++ Foundation trade association in 2012 (see isocpp.org/about);

3) standardization participation, so that meeting attendance is regularly approximately 110 experts organized into 10-15 active subgroups -- this includes domain-specific subgroups (e.g., transactional memory, graphics, gaming) that were established since 2012 and have drawn domain experts who did not previously participate in C++ standardization; and

4) faster and more predictable standardization output, with regular releases of the standard every three years along with many concurrent Technical Specifications (ten completed and published from 2014 to 2017, including the three mentioned above that have completed PDTS comment resolution and will publish this year).

### 2.2. ACHIEVEMENTS

Achievements in the past year include the following.

JTC1.22.14882 - Programming Language C++ - International Standard is in DIS ballot and is expected to be published in 2017.

JTC1.22.19568:2016: C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, 2nd edition

Two Technical Specifications are in progress (modules and parallelism), and two more are expected to be started in the coming year (concurrency 2nd edition, 2D graphics). Much of the content in these and the published TSes are likely candidates for inclusion in the next planned revision of IS 14882 in 2020.

### 2.3. RESOURCES

WG21 has grown considerably over the past two years, which reflects the continued growth and investment in C++ across the industry as noted in 2.1.

WG21 meets three times per year in co-located technical sessions with the US committee PL22.16. WG21 regularly has experts from 8-10 national bodies present at meetings, with 20 countries participating in all by attending these meetings or by being involved in the technical discussions that take place over the committee email lists. The countries are: Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, DPR of Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States of America.  WG21 has been monitoring the cross-language standards activities, and made use of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 guidelines on extended characters.

Liaisons:

- SC22/WG14 - C
  - Michael Wong (Codeplay, USA)
  - Clark Nelson (Intel, USA)
  - Tom Plum (Plum Hall, USA)


## 3. FOCUS NEXT WORK PERIOD

### 3.1. DELIVERABLES

WG21 is working on publishing JTC.22.14882 (IS C++) and progressing several other TS projects as noted in 1.2.2. Several are expected to progress to their next ballot stages, and in some cases to publication, in the next 12 months.

### 3.2. STRATEGIES

WG21 members have been meeting in parallel subgroups and coordinating work between meetings via e-mail lists, teleconferences, and wiki. WG21 is working on revisions to the central IS JTC1.22.14882 on a more regular three-year cadence. In addition, WG21 is parallelizing its work products by producing many work items first as Technical Specifications, which enables each independent work item to progress at its own speed and with less friction, and enables more experimental work to progress outside the main standard until it is more mature while still providing a reference for commercial implementations. When ready, these TS's can then be considered adopted (in whole or in part, and with changes) into the ISO C++ standard.

As of this writing, WG21 has 14 Study Groups, about half of them active, focusing on incubating proposals in specific areas, and which meet between WG21 face-to-face meetings via telecon and/or their own face-to-face meetings. These domain-specific groups have directly led to increased participation by leading experts in those domains who had not previously participated in WG21. For a current list of Study Groups, see [isocpp.org/std/the-committee](http://isocpp.org/std/the-committee).


### 3.3. RISKS

None.

### 3.4. OPPORTUNITIES

Nothing new to report.

### 3.5. WORK PROGRAM PRIORITIES

WG21 intends to continue working on new language and/or library extensions with a view to publishing multiple TSes and then another new JTC1.22.14882 IS in 2017.
